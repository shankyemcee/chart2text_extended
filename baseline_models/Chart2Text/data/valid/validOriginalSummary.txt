The foreign-born population residing in the U.S. reached a record 44.8 million , or 13.7 % of the U.S. population , in 2018 . This immigrant population has more than quadrupled since the 1960s , when the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act took effect . Though growth has begun to slow in recent years , the number of immigrants living in the United States is projected to almost double by 2065 .
Overall , 54 % say that from what they 've read and heard , the amount of energy produced in the U.S. has been increasing in recent years ; just 10 % say it has been decreasing , while 27 % say it 's been staying about the same . Last fall , somewhat fewer ( 48 % ) said they thought energy production in the U.S. was up . College graduates are among the most likely to say the amount of energy produced in the U.S. has been increasing ( 67 % ) ; those with no college experience are less likely to hold this view ( 44 % ) .
Yet the survey also shows that immigration is not a deal breaker issue for many Latino voters . Some 54 % say they would vote for a candidate who disagrees with them on immigration policy if that candidate agrees with them on most other issues . Nonetheless , about one-third ( 36 % ) say they would not vote for a candidate if they disagreed with the candidate on immigration policy .

Over half ( 54 % ) of the Americans who are most likely to sign up for health coverage through the new health care exchanges —the uninsured and those who buy their own coverage — would opt for a plan that costs less even if the coverage is narrower , according to a new Kaiser Health Tracking poll released today . Broader plans at a higher cost would be the choice of 34 % . The public , taken as a whole , leans the other way , with 51 % saying they prefer a plan that costs more money but provides a broader network of providers while 37 % would choose a lower-cost option with less choice .
Combined advertiser expenditures for the evening broadcast news programs , ABC 's World News Tonight , CBS Evening News and NBC Nightly News , were $ 518 million in 2018 , a decline of 6 % compared with 2017 , according to estimates from Kantar Media .

Over just the past week , the share of Americans who oppose U.S. airstrikes in Syria has surged 15 points , from 48 % to 63 % , as many who were undecided about the issue have turned against military action . By contrast , the share of Americans who support airstrikes remains virtually unchanged : Just 28 % favor U.S. military airstrikes against Syria in response to reports that its government used chemical weapons . The new survey by the Pew Research Center and USA TODAY , conducted Sept. 4 - 8 , 2013 among 1,506 adults nationwide , finds that this growing opposition to Syrian airstrikes is intense : 45 % say they oppose airstrikes very strongly .
During the early stages of the outbreak 's economic fallout , 90 % of the decrease in employment – or 2.6 million of the total loss of 2.9 million between February and March – arose from positions that could not be teleworked , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of federal government data .
A solid majority of Americans say the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way journalists report the news , but they are far less certain about how the outbreak is affecting news organizations ' bottom lines , according to an April 20 - 26 survey conducted among 10,139 U.S. adults as part of Pew Research Center 's Election News Pathways project .

The share of blacks serving in a presidential Cabinet was at or above parity with the population during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations . But there was only one black Cabinet secretary during Obama 's first term , and the same is true so far in Donald Trump 's administration . The highest level of black representation in a presidential Cabinet occurred during Bill Clinton 's first term , when four out of 15 Cabinet appointees were black .
There is less agreement in public views about other aspects of campaign coverage . Majorities say they want more coverage of the candidates ' debates ( 57 % ) , their sources of campaign money ( 55 % ) , their personal backgrounds ( 55 % ) , and the candidates who are not frontrunners ( 55 % ) .

On a typical day in August , 26 million Americans were using the internet for news or information about politics and the upcoming mid-term elections . That corresponds to 19 % of adult internet users , or 13 % of all Americans over the age of 18 . Comparing August 2006 figures to a similar point in the 2002 mid-term election cycle is particularly revealing .
As Table One and Chart One show , the presidential and national party campaign organizations accounted for 93 % of the estimated ad spending detected through the Evaliant software in the first seven months of 2004 : Kerry for President ( 49.5 % ) , the Republican National Committee ( 18.3 % ) , Bush for President ( 15.7 % ) , and the Democratic National Committee ( 9.7 % ) .

Unauthorized immigrants were 23 % of the 45.6 million foreign-born residents in the U.S. in 2017 .
Six origin groups – Chinese , Indian , Filipino , Vietnamese , Korean and Japanese – accounted for 85 % of all Asian Americans as of 2015 .

The American public is closely divided over the degree of health risk posed by additives present in the foods we regularly eat . Majorities see at least some risk from eating food produced with common agricultural and processing practices , including meat from animals given hormones or antibiotics , produce grown with pesticides and foods with artificial ingredients . And about half of the public says that foods with genetically modified ( GM ) ingredients are worse for one 's health than foods without , according to a new nationally representative survey from Pew Research Center .
The survey also asks people about whether voting this year will be easy or difficult . A large majority ( 84 % ) of those who plan to vote in the midterms say voting will be easy , though fewer than half ( 44 % ) say they expect it will be very easy . About one-in-seven people ( 15 % ) who plan to vote say it will be difficult .

'' As Americans assess potential problems with health care , most demographic and political groups are closely divided over whether medical treatments are worth the costs because they allow people to live longer and better quality lives , or whether medical treatments often create as many problems as they solve .
Those who perceived at least some effect of climate change in their local community were asked to consider if climate change has had a personal impact in their lives . Overall , about three-in-ten U.S. adults ( 31 % ) say the local effects are directly affecting their personal lives .

A somewhat smaller majority ( 65 % ) says that new campaign finance laws could be written that would be effective in reducing the role of money in politics , while 31 % say any new laws would not be effective .
There are transatlantic differences about defense spending . Successive American presidents have called on NATO allies to spend more on security , and Trump has repeatedly pressed the issue .

As for a preference between the terms Hispanic or Latino , the survey found that 32 % of Hispanics prefer `` Hispanic , '' 15 % prefer the term `` Latino '' and the rest ( 51 % ) have no preference .
People hold mixed assessments about the influences operating on science research . About half of people ( 52 % ) say that the best available scientific evidence influences medical research on childhood vaccines `` most of the time , '' while some 36 % say this occurs `` some of the time '' and another 9 % say this seldom or never happens . There is even less public trust in research connected with climate change and GM foods ; roughly three in 10 people say the best available scientific evidence influences climate research or GM food research `` most of the time .
Americans are more likely than ever to get news from multiple social media sites , according to a recent Pew Research Center report . About a quarter of all U.S. adults ( 26 % ) get news from two or more social media sites , up from 15 % in 2013 and 18 % in 2016 . But there is considerable variation in the extent to which each site 's news users get news from other sites , and which sites those are .
These shifts are particularly pronounced among ideological partisans . In 2015 , liberal Democrats and Democratic leaners were divided in their assessments of whether their side was losing more ( 44 % ) or winning more ( 46 % ) . Today , fully 81 % of liberal Democrats say they are losing more , while just 12 % say they are winning .
American voters are generally skeptical that either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump would make a `` great '' or `` good '' president . But another dynamic in the 2016 presidential election is the significant share of voters who say their vote is based more on which candidate they are against rather than which one they are for . In a recent Pew Research Center survey , 53 % of Clinton supporters say they consider their vote more in support of her , while 46 % say their vote is more against Trump .
Trump viewed as candidate of ‘ change , ' not necessarily for the better . Fully 77 % of voters say Trump would change the way things work in Washington , compared with just 45 % who say the same about Clinton . But more voters say Trump would change things for the worse than for the better ( 44 % vs. 33 % ) .
Americans are supportive of the space program and space exploration . In a 2011 Pew Research survey , 58 % of Americans said it is essential that the U.S. be a world leader in space exploration .
While a 55 % majority of Trump supporters say the party would unite behind him , they are somewhat more skeptical about this than McCain and Romney supporters were during the 2008 and 2012 primaries , respectively . In 2008 , 64 % of McCain supporters said the party would unite behind him , while 75 % of Romney supporters said this in 2012 . Cruz and Kasich supporters are more skeptical of Trump 's ability to unite the party than were supporters of prior candidates who did not become the GOP 's eventual nominee in past elections .
About eight-in-ten ( 81 % ) Israeli adults are Jewish , while the remainder are mostly ethnically Arab and religiously Muslim ( 14 % ) , Christian ( 2 % ) or Druze ( 2 % ) . Overall , the Arab religious minorities in Israel are more religiously observant than Jews . And these groups all are largely isolated from one another socially ; there is virtually no religious intermarriage in Israel , and strong majorities of Jews , Muslims , Christians and Druze say all or most of their close friends belong to their own religious group .

For women who lived with their spouse before marriage , the probability of being married for at least 20 years is somewhat lower – 46 % . Whether the couple was engaged when they lived together did n't make a difference in women 's chances of long-lasting marriages .
What we found – perhaps not surprisingly – is that , in general , feelings of political `` losing '' are associated with higher levels of anger toward government . Among those who say their side loses more than it wins politically , 27 % are angry at the federal government – three times the percentage among those who feel like their side wins more frequently ( 9 % ) .
Russians and Ukrainians disagree on what to do about the regions in eastern Ukraine , where the separatist movement has been the strongest . Ukrainians would like the Luhans'k and Donets'k regions to remain part of Ukraine , either with the same terms as before the conflict ( 51 % ) or with more autonomy from Kyiv ( 33 % ) . But Russians prefer that the region either become independent states ( 35 % ) or part of Russia ( 24 % ) , rather than stay with Ukraine ( 32 % ) .
The more serious forms of harassment are less frequent : 10 % of men and 6 % of women said they had been physically threatened on online platforms and similar shares said they had been harassed for a sustained period of time , stalked or sexually harassed .
About half of the public ( 51 % ) express unfavorable views of Speaker of the House John Boehner , while 22 % have a favorable opinion of him ( 26 % hold no opinion ) . A smaller share of the public has an opinion of Senate Majority Leader McConnell ; however , about as many rate him favorably as Boehner ( 23 % ) and fewer ( 38 % ) have an unfavorable opinion of him ( 39 % have no opinion ) .
When it comes to parenting , dads are harder on themselves than moms are , especially dads who say they do n't spend enough time with their children . Among working dads who say they spend too little time with their kids , only 49 % say they are doing an excellent or good job as a parent . In contrast , among dads who say they spend the right amount of time with their kids , 81 % give themselves high marks for their parenting .
Highly educated women are more likely to work during the pregnancy preceding their first birth than less educated women . The latest data indicate that 87 % of women with a bachelor 's degree or higher worked while pregnant with their first child . By contrast , just 28 % of women without a high school diploma worked while pregnant with their first child , a disparity that parallels full-time employment rates by educational attainment more broadly .
One reason mothers are more likely than fathers to say it 's harder to get ahead in the workplace may be that women are much more likely than men to experience a variety of family-related career interruptions . About four-in-ten working mothers ( 42 % ) say that at some point in their working life , they had reduced their hours in order to care for a child or other family member , while just 28 % of working fathers say they had done the same ; almost as many working mothers ( 39 % ) say they had taken a significant amount of time off from work for one of these reasons , compared with about a quarter ( 24 % ) of working fathers . And mothers are more likely than fathers to say they quit their job at some point for family reasons , by 27 % to 10 % .
President Obama 's job approval has ticked up in recent months , to 48 % currently , and his rating dwarfs the 26 % approval measure for the leaders of the new Republican Congress . Yet the public is divided over whether Obama or Republican congressional leaders should take the lead in solving the nation 's problems : 40 % say Obama while 38 % say GOP leaders . That is virtually unchanged from a few days after the midterm elections in November .
An 83 % majority of the public says vaccines for diseases such as measles , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) are safe for healthy children , while about one-in-ten ( 9 % ) think such vaccines are not safe . An additional 7 % volunteer that they do n't know .
While the public continues to say a new economic stimulus package is needed to address the impact of the coronavirus , Republicans have turned more skeptical about the need for additional economic stimulus .

While many Americans and Germans name China as the most important partner , negative attitudes toward the Asian superpower have increased in both countries over the past year . The two publics have also become more likely to prioritize U.S.-German ties over relations with China . In the September 2020 survey , 55 % of Americans prefer to have a close relationship with Germany rather than China ( 35 % ) .
Despite the overall sentiment in the U.S. that favors a stronger relationship with Germany , younger Americans are more divided . About four-in-ten of those ages 18 to 29 say it is more important to have a close relationship with Germany , compared with 47 % who say the same about China . Older Americans are much more likely to prefer Germany over China .
Trump has appointed more federal appeals court judges to date than any recent president at the same point in their presidency . The overall number of federal judges Trump has appointed to date ( 194 ) is similar to the number appointed by George W. Bush at the same juncture in his presidency ( 197 ) . Trump , however , stands out for his unusually large number of appeals court judges — the powerful regional jurists who have the final word on most appeals that do not end up in the Supreme Court and who frequently end up becoming Supreme Court justices themselves .
Costner 's fellow Southerners are among the strongest critics of the Supreme Court 's rulings on school prayer . More than seven-in-ten people ( 73 % ) living in the South say they disapprove of the high court 's decisions on the topic in the 2012 GSS . But many in Costner 's generation have a different view .
Among those who prioritize gun rights , 41 % say they would not vote for a candidate with whom they disagreed on gun policy , even if they agreed with the candidate on most other issues . Fewer gun control supporters ( 31 % ) say gun policy is a make-or-break voting issue for them .

Reports of a rise in income inequality are particularly high in the advanced economies , where a median of 80 % say things have gotten worse , compared with medians of 70 % in the developing economies and 59 % in the emerging markets .
By comparison , the Washington Post/ABC News survey described the situation as follows : The AP reported classified information about U.S. anti-terrorism efforts and prosecutors have obtained AP 's phone records through a court order . Do you think this action by federal prosecutors is or is not justified ? The survey found substantially more saying the actions were justified , by a 52 % -33 % margin . The difference is likely attributable to three differences in the way the surveys described the situation .
Israelis and Palestinians also differ on views of Obama . About six-in-ten ( 61 % ) Israelis express confidence in the American president to do the right thing regarding world affairs , up from 49 % in 2011 . In the Palestinian territories , just 15 % have confidence in Obama , while 82 % have little or no confidence in him .

Television was far-and-away the most widely-used source of information about the bombing and its aftermath ; 80 % of Americans followed the story on TV . About half ( 49 % ) say they kept up with news and information online or on a mobile device , and 38 % followed the story on the radio . Only 29 % say they kept up with the story in newspapers , about the same number ( 26 % ) tracked the story on social networking sites like Facebook or Twitter .
Nearly a quarter ( 23 % ) of those who say gun rights should be the priority have contributed money to an organization that takes a position on gun policy , compared with just 5 % of those who prioritize gun control . People who favor gun rights are also about twice as likely as gun control supporters to have contacted a public official about gun policy ( 15 % vs. 8 % ) . By contrast , comparable percentages of gun rights supporters ( 19 % ) and those who prioritize gun control ( 15 % ) say they have expressed their opinion about gun policy on social networks .
In 2005 , 8 % of men and 6 % of women used social media . Starting in 2009 , women started using social media at slightly higher rates than men , although this balance has shrunk yet again in recent years . Today , 68 % of women and 62 % of men report social media usage , a difference that is not statistically significant .
In 2014 , just 28 % of Millennials were married . This makes them remarkably different than members of the Silent Generation at the same stage in their lives : fully 64 % of Silents were married when members of their generation were between the ages of 18 and 33 . About half ( 49 % ) of Baby Boomers and 38 % of Gen Xers were married when their generation was ages 18 to 33 .
The pattern of religious identity is another fundamental difference between the generations . Older generations identify overwhelmingly as Christian . For example , 85 % of the Silent generation identify as a member of a Christian denomination , while just 11 % say they are religiously unaffiliated ( defined as atheist , agnostic or `` nothing in particular '' ) .
Given that , as of 2010 , only about a quarter ( 24 % ) of the global Catholic population is from Europe , the continent remains heavily overrepresented among voting cardinals . By this measure , the most underrepresented continent within the church 's leadership – even with Francis ' new picks – is Latin America and the Caribbean , which is home to 39 % of the worldwide Catholic population ( again , as of 2010 ) and has 19 % of the cardinals .
Congregants may not be physically sitting in the pews each Sunday , but their house of worship is most likely streaming or recording its services so that people can access them virtually . Among U.S. adults who report attending religious services at least monthly , 82 % say that the place of worship they most often attend is streaming or recording its services so that people can watch them online or on TV . About one-in-eight ( 12 % ) say their primary place of worship has not done this , while the remainder say they do n't know ( 5 % ) .
In New England , 62 % favor same-sex marriage , while 29 % oppose it . In the mid-Atlantic , 57 % favor and 34 % oppose allowing gay marriage . Opinions among those on the Pacific Coast are similar ( 54 % favor , 37 % oppose ) .
Aside from being asked about their generational identity , respondents also were asked how well each generational term applies . In this case , the differences between Boomers and the other three generations are even starker . Seven-in-ten Boomers ( 70 % ) say the term `` Baby-Boom generation '' applies to them very well ( 31 % ) or fairly well ( 39 % ) .
Students receive the highest marks from these teachers for their ability to use appropriate and effective search queries and their understanding of how online search results are generated . Yet even for these skills , only about one-quarter of teachers surveyed here rate their students `` excellent '' or `` very good . '' Indeed , in our focus groups , many teachers suggest that despite being raised in the `` digital age , '' today 's students are surprisingly lacking in their online search skills .
Over the past two months , the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has had a devastating impact on nearly all aspects of life in the United States . And now , most Americans expect it will disrupt the presidential election in November . With just over six months until Election Day , two-thirds of Americans ( 67 % ) – including 80 % of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents and half of Republicans and Republican leaners – say it is very or somewhat likely that the coronavirus outbreak will significantly disrupt people 's ability to vote in the presidential election .
In addition , while the budget deficit remains a very important issue for most voters , there continues to be broad agreement that the best way to reduce the budget deficit is with a combination of tax increases and cuts in major programs . In the new survey , fully 69 % of registered voters say the best way to reduce the federal budget deficit is with a combination of tax increases and spending cuts ; just 16 % say the focus should be mostly on cutting major programs and just 6 % say the deficit should be reduced mostly by increasing taxes .
The controversial comments about rape and abortion made by Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin drew limited public attention . One-in-four ( 25 % ) followed this story very closely , but another one-in-three ( 33 % ) say they did not follow this closely at all . Interest in the Akin controversy was most widespread among Democrats , 34 % of whom followed this very closely , compared with 25 % of Republicans and just 19 % of independents .

While a 59 % majority of all voters say elections in the United States were run and administered well , just 21 % of Trump supporters have a positive view of how elections were administered nationally . Among Biden supporters , 94 % say the elections were run and administered well .
Contrasting Asia-Pacific views of China may in part be explained by differing levels of concern about regional territorial disputes with Beijing . The Filipinos ( 91 % concerned ) , Vietnamese ( 83 % ) and Japanese ( 83 % ) are the most troubled by these territorial frictions , according to a 2015 Pew Research Center survey of Asia-Pacific perceptions of various global threats . And they are also the three countries in the region with the highest unfavorable ratings of China .
Young adults are especially likely to use their mobile phones to keep themselves occupied while watching television , as nearly three quarters of all cell owners ages 18 - 24 ( 73 % ) used their cell phone in this manner recently . But while this behavior is especially common among the youngest cell owners , a majority of 25 - 34 year olds and just under half of those in their mid-30s to mid-40s have done this recently .
The Center 's 2019 survey found that sizable majorities of Nigerians expressed positive views toward China on a variety of economic issues : 83 % said China 's growing economy is a good thing for their country , while a comparable share ( 82 % ) said Chinese investment is a good thing because it creates jobs in their country . In both cases , these shares were the highest out of the 11 emerging economies surveyed by the Center in 2019 .

Disapproval of the president 's job performance , anger at the federal government and opposition to the health care legislation also are closely associated with support for Republican candidates .
The Daily Show attracts a much younger news consumer than cable and network news shows . The median age of Web-using adults who got news from The Daily Show was 36 years last year , similar to that of its then-companion show , The Colbert Report ( 33 years ) .

The electorate in last year 's presidential election was the most racially and ethnically diverse in U.S. history , with nearly one-in-four votes cast by non-whites , according to a new analysis of Census Bureau data by the Pew Research Center .1 The nation 's three biggest minority groups—blacks , Hispanics and Asians—each accounted for unprecedented shares of the presidential vote in 2008 . Overall , whites2 made up 76.3 % of the record 131 million people3 who voted in November 's presidential election , while blacks made up 12.1 % , Hispanics 7.4 % and Asians 2.5 % .4 The white share is the lowest ever , yet is still higher than the 65.8 % white share of the total U.S. population ( Pew Hispanic Center , 2009 ) .
In 2018 , Asian and white immigrants were much more likely than Hispanic and black immigrants to work in nonmechanical , high-skill occupations . For example , 42 % of Asian immigrants and 36 % of white immigrants worked in jobs where analytical skills are most important , such as chemical engineers and computer programmers , compared with 23 % of black immigrants and just 11 % of Hispanic immigrants .

Most Hispanic voters ( 71 % ) say the government should do more to solve problems , while 27 % say government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals . Hispanic Democratic and Republican registered voters have sharply different views on the role of government , though the gap is not as wide as it is among the broader U.S. public .
While Valentine 's Day is widely celebrated as a time for peak romance – and even marriage proposals – marriage is n't the only way to achieve happiness and contentment for many Americans .

This was true not only in Muslim countries such as Morocco and Turkey , but in France and Germany as well .
Throughout Europe governments are wrestling with how far to go to respond to calls to lift the veil and ban the head scarf .

This is the narrowest end-of-year difference in overall internet penetration between rural and non-rural Americans that we have recorded .
To get a glimpse of how America 's racial demographics are changing , take a look at the differences between mixed-race Americans old and young . The racial background of the largest group of multiracial babies ( 36 % ) is black and white , but just 18 % of mixed-race adults claim this background , according to Census Bureau data . A similar pattern emerges for mixed-race people whose background is black and American Indian – among adults , the share is 5 % , while among babies , it is just 1 % .
Yet it remains the case that the differences between the two parties are starker than those within the two parties . Across 30 political values – encompassing attitudes about guns , race , immigration , foreign policy and other realms – the average partisan gap is 39 percentage points . Across all 30 political values , the differences between Republicans and Democrats dwarf all other differences by demographics or other factors .
Despite the economic troubles facing the news industry , about seven-in-ten Americans ( 71 % ) believe their local news media organizations are doing well financially . This belief persists even though only 14 % of U.S. adults say they personally have paid for local news within the past year , whether through subscriptions , donations or memberships . When asked why they do n't pay for local news , around half of non-payers ( 49 % ) point to the widespread availability of free content .
The U.S. public renders a harsh judgment on the state of political discourse in the country today . Large majorities of Americans say the tone and nature of political debate has become more negative in recent years , as well as less respectful , less fact-based and less substantive . President Donald Trump is a major factor in people 's views : A 55 % majority says Trump has changed the tone and nature of political debate in the country for the worse .
An estimated 2.3 million Hispanics of Salvadoran origin resided in the United States in 2017 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey . Salvadorans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Salvadoran origin ; this includes immigrants from El Salvador and those who trace their family ancestry to El Salvador . Salvadorans are the third-largest population ( tied with Cubans ) of Hispanic origin living in the United States , accounting for 4 % of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017 .
Most countries and territories allow voters abroad to cast ballots in some capacity . That 's the case in the U.S. and another 151 of the 216 countries and territories evaluated by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance , at least for national legislative , European Parliament or presidential elections . Among those , many allow external voting for legislative elections ( 124 ) , presidential elections ( 88 ) or referenda ( 74 ) , and just 24 allow it for sub-national elections .
The United States stands out to many around the world as the country their own nation can rely on most , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . Pluralities or majorities in around half of the 17 countries where an open-ended question was asked named the U.S. as their most dependable ally going forward . At the same time , substantial shares of people in some countries also perceive Washington as their greatest threat .
Half of Americans say that their European allies should keep national defense spending at current levels , while 35 % say these allies should increase their defense spending . Only around one-in-ten ( 9 % ) say European allies should decrease their defense spending . Germans are more divided .
Overall , about half of Americans ( 49 % ) say human activity contributes a great deal to climate change , and another 30 % say human actions have some role in climate change . Two-in-ten ( 20 % ) believe human activity plays not too much or no role at all in climate change .
Partisanship and ideology remain some of the strongest factors underlying attitudes about whether Earth is warming , our survey finds . Today , roughly nine-in-ten liberal Democrats ( 92 % ) say that there is solid evidence Earth 's average temperature is rising , and 76 % attribute this rise mostly to human activity . Very few liberal Democrats ( 5 % ) say there is not solid evidence of warming .
Eight-in-ten Americans ( 80 % ) report that they reduce their food waste for environmental reasons . Large shares of the public ( 72 % ) say they use fewer plastics that can not be reused such as plastic bags , straws , cups or reduce their water consumption ( 68 % ) to help the environment .
Looking ahead , a majority of smart speaker owners also are not seeking more personalization . Different groups of respondents were asked about their desires for the performance of their speakers in the future . In one group , 58 % of smart speaker owners say they would not like their speaker to do a better job of taking their interests and preferences into account in the future , compared with 42 % who would like their speakers to do a better job taking their interests and preferences into account .
People with positive views of populist parties in Europe tend to have a much less favorable attitude toward the European Union . The starkest difference appears in Germany , where those who support the right-wing Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) party are 34 percentage points less likely to express a favorable view of the EU than people who do not support AfD .
Germans in both areas say living standards in the former East have not yet caught up with those in the former West . Around three-quarters of people in the former East Germany ( 74 % ) and around two-thirds of those in the former West ( 66 % ) say the East still has not achieved the same living standards as the West , according to the Center 's recent survey , which was conducted among representative samples of adults in both areas as part of a larger study of Europe .
Among cohabiters who are not currently engaged , half of those with a bachelor 's degree or more education and 43 % of those with some college experience say they saw moving in with their partner as step toward marriage . Smaller shares of those with a high school diploma or less education ( 28 % ) say the same .
Views of the economy are closely associated with party affiliation and where people stand on the political spectrum , less so the EU referendum vote . The British public was roughly divided on their views of the economy , with 49 % saying that the economic situation is bad in the UK and 50 % saying that it is good . Positive views were concentrated among Conservative supporters and those on the political right , with a slimmer majority among `` leave '' voters .
Overall , about six-in-ten U.S. adults ( 62 % ) say it 's very or somewhat acceptable for professional athletes to speak out publicly about political issues , while 35 % say this is not too or not at all acceptable . But these views differ by age , race and ethnicity – and especially political affiliation . About three-quarters ( 74 % ) of adults ages 18 to 29 say it is very or somewhat acceptable for professional athletes to speak out publicly about politics .
Discontentment among Argentines extends across a wide range of conditions in the country . Overall , 72 % of Argentines say they are pessimistic with how the political system works when thinking about the future . Those with a favorable view of the ruling party are less likely to feel pessimistic about the way their political system works than those with an unfavorable view ( 58 % vs. 78 % ) , though majorities of both are still pessimistic .
Pairing a survey with an examination of the Twitter behaviors of U.S. adults also allows for a comparison of the attitudes and characteristics of political tweeters with those of other Twitter users . Political tweeters – defined as those who tweeted at least five times in total , and at least twice about national politics , over the year of the study period – are almost twice as likely as other Twitter users to say the people they follow on Twitter have political beliefs similar to their own ( 38 % of political tweeters say this , compared with around one-in-five among nonpolitical tweeters ) . By contrast , nonpolitical tweeters are more likely to say they are n't sure about the political beliefs of the people they follow or that they follow people with a mix of political views .
This survey finds that this is indeed the case . Examining the group of individuals asked about their comfort or likely engagement with all three steps , we find that fully seven-in-ten of those who are very confident that public health organizations will protect their personal records from hackers or unauthorized users also say that they would be comfortable or likely to engage with all three steps of the process . That compares with smaller shares of those who express less confidence ( 56 % of those who are somewhat confident , 36 % of those who are not too confident and 21 % of those who are not at all confident ) .
Nearly two-thirds of women ( 64 % ) favor stricter gun laws , compared with 55 % of men . Adults with at least a four-year college degree are more likely than those who have not completed to college to support stricter laws ( 72 % vs. 55 % ) .
The share of Republicans who give Democrats a `` cold '' rating on a 0 - 100 thermometer has risen 14 percentage points since 2016 – with virtually all of the increase coming in `` very cold '' ratings ( 0 - 24 ) . Democrats ' views of Republicans have followed a similar trajectory : 57 % give Republicans a very cold rating , up from 41 % three years ago .
Yet Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to view members of the opposing party as unpatriotic . A 63 % majority of Republicans say that , compared with other Americans , Democrats are `` more unpatriotic . '' Just 23 % of Democrats say the same about Republicans .
Among the 65 % with a positive view of capitalism , many give reasons that contrast with criticisms of socialism . For example , while many who hold a negative view of socialism say it undermines initiative and makes people too dependent on government , nearly a quarter of those with a positive view of capitalism say it promotes individual opportunity ( 24 % say this ) . Nearly a quarter of Americans who have a positive view of capitalism ( 24 % ) say they hold their views because the system provides opportunity for individual financial growth .
As of this past summer , roughly two-thirds of Americans said they would like to see tighter e-cigarette regulations . In a July 2019 Gallup survey , 64 % of U.S. adults said laws and regulations covering e-cigarettes should be made more strict , while around a quarter ( 26 % ) said regulations should stay as they are now . Just 5 % said these laws and regulations should be less strict .
A majority of U.S. adults ( 64 % ) say social media have a mostly negative effect on the way things are going in the country today , with Republicans being more likely than Democrats to express that view , according to a July 2020 survey . The Americans who see a negative effect from social media point to factors including misinformation and the hate and harassment they see on these platforms .
The new survey by Pew Research Center , conducted July 22-August 4 among 4,175 adults , also finds little support for overturning Roe v. Wade , the landmark Supreme Court decision that established a woman 's right to an abortion . Seven-in-ten say they do not want to see the Roe v. Wade decision completely overturned ; 28 % say they would like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn the 1973 decision .
Colleges are continuing to adapt amid new outbreaks in certain COVID-19 hotspots . Against this backdrop , the public has mixed views on whether providing in-person instruction this fall was a good idea . Half of all U.S. adults say colleges and universities that brought students back to campus made the right decision , while 48 % say they did not , according to a new Pew Research Center survey .
Are smartphones and social media changing social interactions in emerging economies , or are people simply talking to the same people online that they once talked to offline ? A Pew Research Center survey of adults in 11 nations across four global regions finds that , in many key respects , smartphone users – and especially those who use social media – are more regularly exposed to people who have different backgrounds and more connected with friends they do n't see in person . Those with smartphones are also more likely to have accessed new information about health and government services .
About nine-in-ten ( 89 % ) of those surveyed think of research scientists as intelligent . Three-quarters ( 75 % ) see scientists as focused on solving real-world problems . Similar shares say they consider scientists to be skilled at working in teams ( 72 % ) or honest ( 71 % ) .
Republicans are less positive in their views of undocumented immigrants . Still , nearly two-thirds of Republicans ( 64 % ) say undocumented immigrants in the U.S. mostly take jobs citizens do not want , and a narrow majority ( 54 % ) say they are as honest and hardworking as U.S. citizens .
A majority of Americans ( 54 % ) disapprove of the U.S. government 's collection of telephone and internet data as part of anti-terrorism efforts , while 42 % approve of the program . Democrats are divided on the program , while Republicans and independents are more likely to disapprove than approve , according to a survey we conducted in spring 2014 .
Half or more of Americans have positive views about each of six professional groups asked about in the survey . The public is warmest toward medical doctors : About three-quarters ( 74 % ) say they have a mostly positive view of doctors , 18 % are neutral and just 8 % have a negative view . Majorities also have positive opinions of medical researchers ( 68 % ) , dietitians ( 60 % ) , environmental health specialists ( 60 % ) and environmental researchers ( 57 % ) .
A Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2018 , before any of the current contenders announced their candidacy , found that more than four-in-ten Americans ( 45 % ) said they personally hoped a woman would be elected president in their lifetime . About half of all women ( 51 % ) said they personally hoped this would happen , compared with 38 % of men .
Republicans ' views of Mueller 's investigation , which were generally negative over the probe 's two-year course , are much more positive now that it has been completed . Six-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning independents now say they are confident in the fairness of the investigation . In January , just 39 % of Republicans said they were confident Mueller was conducting a fair inquiry .
In 2018 , nearly half ( 47 % ) of the world 's resettled refugees were from Middle Eastern countries , while almost one-third ( 32 % ) were from Africa . People from Middle Eastern countries – mostly Syria and Iraq – accounted for 49 % of resettled refugees in Australia , 55 % in Canada and 85 % in the UK . By contrast , fewer than 1 % of refugees resettled in the U.S. in 2018 were from the Middle East , in part due to shifting regional caps .
Among people with partners , many more bisexual adults are married or in a relationship with someone of the opposite sex than are with someone of the same sex – 88 % say this . This is likely due at least in part to the fact that LGB adults make up a small share of the overall adult population , so the pool of potential same-sex partners is much smaller than the pool of opposite-sex partners . Meanwhile , all the respondents in the survey who identified as straight were in opposite-sex relationships , and nearly all ( 94 % ) of those who identified as gay or lesbian were in same-sex relationships .
Black adults are particularly likely to say slavery continues to have an impact : More than eight-in-ten say this is the case , including 59 % who say the legacy of slavery affects the situation of black people a great deal . By comparison , 26 % of whites , 29 % of Hispanics and 33 % of Asians say slavery affects the position of black people in American society today a great deal , though majorities of each group say it does so at least a fair amount .
People from the Northern Triangle – El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras – make up 85 % of migrants apprehended in Mexico so far in fiscal 2019 . Migrants from these countries have historically accounted for the most apprehensions in Mexico , but their share so far in the current fiscal year is the lowest in nearly two decades — 10 percentage points lower than in 2002 , when they made up 95 % of all apprehensions in Mexico .
A clear majority of U.S. adults think recent reports of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church reflect problems that are still happening . Around eight-in-ten Americans ( 79 % ) say the reports of sexual abuse and misconduct by Catholic priests and bishops reflect ongoing problems , while far fewer ( 12 % ) think the reports reflect problems that happened in the past .
Like Americans overall , Catholics are divided by party on the question of whether abortion should be legal . Most Catholics who identify as Republican or lean toward the Republican Party ( 63 % ) said abortion should be illegal in all or most cases , while an even larger share of Catholics who identify as Democrats or lean that way ( 77 % ) said abortion should be legal in all or most cases , the 2019 survey showed . Still , roughly one-third of Catholic Republicans ( 36 % ) favored legal abortion , while 17 % of Catholic Democrats opposed it , reflecting some dissent within both parties on this issue .
A narrow majority of Americans ( 54 % ) support the death penalty for people convicted of murder , according to a spring 2018 survey . But only around a third of blacks ( 36 % ) support capital punishment for this crime , compared with nearly six-in-ten whites ( 59 % ) .
Many adult Facebook users have altered their use of the platform . A little over half of adult Facebook users in the U.S. ( 54 % ) have adjusted their privacy settings in the past 12 months , according to a separate Center survey conducted in May-June 2018 . The survey followed revelations that former consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had collected data on tens of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge or permission .
Barack Obama 's overall approval ratings have been stable over the course of 2015 . Currently about as many say they approve of the way Barack Obama is handling his job as president as say they disapprove of his job performance ( 46 % vs. 48 % ) . But on several other key policy areas , there is more disapproval than approval of Obama 's performance .
A 2018 Center survey found that some Facebook users had recently taken steps to moderate their use of the site – such as deleting the Facebook app from their phone or taking a break from the platform for some time . But despite these findings and amid some high profile controversies , Facebook users as a whole are just as active on the site today as they were a year ago . Roughly three-quarters of Facebook users ( 74 % ) visit the site daily , including about half who do so several times a day .
While U.S. Jews have a strong attachment to Israel , they are divided in their assessment of Trump 's handling of the Israeli-Palestinian issue , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . Roughly four-in-ten ( 42 % ) say they think Trump is favoring the Israelis too much , while a similar share ( 47 % ) say he is striking the right balance between the Israelis and Palestinians . The rest either say he is favoring the Palestinians too much ( 6 % ) or they do n't know ( 4 % ) .
The survey also shows that roughly eight-in-ten evangelical Protestants ( 79 % ) have a favorable view of the Israeli people , as do seven-in-ten mainline Protestants and about two-thirds of Catholics . People in all three groups are far more likely to say they have a favorable view of the Israeli people than they are to say the same of the Palestinian people . By contrast , religiously unaffiliated people and those in the historically black Protestant tradition are more ambivalent toward Israelis .
However , far fewer ( 63 % ) feel it is important to be able to `` go around in public without always being identified . '' Only 34 % believe being able to go unnoticed in public is `` very important '' and 29 % say it is `` somewhat important '' to them . In both cases , all adults , regardless of age or gender , express comparable views .
In some ways , the findings from the new survey mirror results from the head-to-head question about sympathies . Among the public overall , larger shares have favorable opinions of both the Israeli people ( 64 % very or somewhat favorable ) and the Israeli government ( 41 % ) than of the Palestinian people ( 46 % ) and the Palestinian government ( 19 % ) .
To better understand this , we added a follow-up to our initial questions on diversity , gender equality , family ties and religion : Is this a good or bad thing for the country ? To accurately classify these responses , we took people who said there was an increase ( for example in diversity ) and that this was a good thing , and then combined them with people who said diversity had decreased and they felt this was bad . On the other side , we combined people who said there was an increase and that it was bad with those who saw a decrease in diversity and thought it was good for society .
Those who have had the most exposure to information about the government surveillance programs also have some of the strongest views about data retention limits for certain kinds of organizations . These differences are particularly notable when considering social media sites . Among those who have heard `` a lot '' about the government collecting communications data as part of anti-terrorism efforts , 55 % say that the social media sites they use should not save any information regarding their activity , compared with 35 % of those who have heard `` a little '' about the government monitoring programs .
For many Americans , going online is an important way to connect with friends and family , shop , get news and search for information . Yet today , 10 % of U.S. adults do not use the internet , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of survey data . For instance , seniors are much more likely than younger adults to say they never go online .
Residents in the three types of communities also differ on how important they think the internet is for getting local news . Urban residents are more digitally focused in their local news habits , placing greater emphasis on the internet for local news . About four-in-ten urban residents ( 37 % ) say the internet is their most important source of local news , compared with 32 % in suburban areas and 26 % of those in rural areas .
Young adults and part-time workers are especially likely to have been personally affected by workforce automation . In 2017 , 13 % of those ages 18 to 24 had either lost a job or had pay or hours reduced because their employers replaced their positions with a machine , robot or computer program . That compares with slightly smaller shares of those ages 30 and older .
Americans are divided over whose responsibility it is to take care of displaced workers in the event of far-reaching job automation . Half of U.S. adults said that in the event that robots and computers are capable of doing many human jobs , it is the government 's obligation to take care of displaced workers , even if it means raising taxes substantially , according to the 2017 survey . A nearly identical share ( 49 % ) said that obligation should fall on the individual , even if machines have already taken many human jobs .
The survey – which , again , was largely completed before Barr 's report on the Mueller investigation – finds that 64 % of Americans say that Trump definitely ( 33 % ) or probably ( 31 % ) has done something illegal while in office or when he was running for president . Only half as many ( 32 % ) say he definitely or probably has not done things that are illegal . An even larger share ( 72 % ) thinks Trump definitely or probably has done something unethical – with 46 % saying he has definitely done this .
When asked to elaborate on the main reason why they think social media have a mostly negative effect on the way things are going in this country today , roughly three-in-ten ( 28 % ) respondents who hold that view mention the spreading of misinformation and made-up news . Smaller shares reference examples of hate , harassment , conflict and extremism ( 16 % ) as a main reason , and 11 % mention a perceived lack of critical thinking skills among many users – voicing concern about people who use these sites believing everything they see or read or being unsure about what to believe .
Meanwhile , 58 % of adults in India say that no matter who wins an election , things do not change very much . This again includes a majority of both BJP and Congress supporters .
A majority of Indians ( 55 % ) see the situation in Kashmir as a very big problem . When asked how this issue has changed over the past five years , more than half ( 53 % ) say circumstances in Kashmir have gotten worse . Only 18 % think things have gotten better , and just 6 % believe conditions are the same .
A majority of parents are concerned about the types of experiences their teen might encounter online . Roughly two-thirds of parents of teens ( 65 % ) say they worry at least some about their teen spending too much time in front of screens , including a third who worry a lot about this . Parents express comparable levels of concern about other potentially negative online experiences for their kids : About six-in-ten say they worry a lot or some about their teen losing the ability to have in-person conversations , sharing too much about themselves online , being bullied online or exchanging explicit messages .
Parents generally get positive ratings from teens about their efforts to tackle online harassment and bullying . Roughly six-in-ten teens ( 59 % ) say parents are doing an excellent or good job at addressing cyberbullying – a notably positive assessment , considering how teens rate other groups measured in this survey . Teens are far less likely to rate the anti-bullying efforts of elected officials , social media companies and teachers positively .
Partisans have starkly different ideas about what steps the federal government should take to improve life in the future . Democrats and Republicans differ notably in the policies they believe the federal government should enact to improve life for future generations . About two-thirds of Republicans ( 65 % ) , for example , say reducing the number of undocumented immigrants coming into the U.S. should be a top priority for the federal government , but just 17 % of Democrats agree .
There is also widespread pessimism about the economic future . Majorities in most of the nations polled say that when children in their country grow up , they will be worse off financially than their parents , including eight-in-ten people in France who hold this view . Poland again stands out as having more positive views : 59 % of Poles are optimistic about the next generation 's economic prospects .
Across the countries surveyed , fewer than half say they approve of the way the EU is handling European economic issues ( median of 40 % ) , Brexit ( median of 38 % ) and the refugee issue ( median of 23 % ) . Ratings of the EU 's performance , however , vary widely from country to country .
More Europeans believe immigrants want to be distinct rather than adopt their new countries ' customs . A median of 38 % say migrants are willing to adopt their customs and way of life while 51 % believe immigrants want to remain distinct from the broader society .
A median of 57 % say immigration increases the risk of terrorism in their countries , while 38 % say it has no impact . Still , in France , Spain and the UK , half or more believe immigration does not increase the odds of terrorism .
The new survey finds that while large majorities of voters think that the elections in their community will be run and administered very or somewhat well , they are less confident in the administration of elections throughout the country . And voters ' confidence in elections in the United States has declined since 2018 – with most of the change coming among voters who supported Republican candidates then and Trump today . Currently , 90 % of registered voters say they are very ( 44 % ) or somewhat confident ( 46 % ) that elections in their community will be run and administered very or somewhat well .
The balance of leaned partisan affiliation among the public has changed little in recent years : 48 % identify with the Democratic Party or lean Democratic , while 39 % identify as Republicans or lean toward the GOP . Since 1992 , only once – in 2002 – have as many people leaned toward the Republican Party as the Democratic Party ( 43 % each ) . They crossed over two times , one in 2002 as stated and once in 1994 ( 44 % R , 44 % D ) .
Voters are in broad agreement about the importance of ensuring that all people who are legally qualified and want to vote are able to cast their ballots : Nearly all registered voters ( 99 % ) say this is at least somewhat important , including 92 % who say it is very important . Sizable majorities of voters ( 84 % ) also say it is at least somewhat important that people who are not legally qualified to vote are prevented from voting , though fewer say this is very important ( 65 % ) . With the expectation that a far larger share of voters will cast their ballots by mail than in past elections comes the prospect that counting those ballots may take substantially longer than in past years .
About six-in-ten Germans name France as one of their country 's top two foreign policy partners , while roughly one-third name the U.S . These results are consistent across a range of political parties : Supporters of the CDU/CSU , their coalition partner the SPD , the Left Party and the Greens all rank France and the U.S. as Germany 's most important foreign policy allies . Russia and China rank third and fourth , respectively , as the most important foreign policy partner across selected political parties except for the Greens , where these countries ' rankings are reversed .
But on the specific benefits of trade , Germans and Americans are less convinced . For example , only about three-in-ten Germans and Americans say that trade increases wages . Just under four-in-ten in each country say trade with other countries creates jobs .
As the debate over college admissions policies reignites , a new Pew Research Center survey finds that most Americans ( 73 % ) say colleges and universities should not consider race or ethnicity when making decisions about student admissions . Just 7 % say race should be a major factor in college admissions , while 19 % say it should be a minor factor . While majorities across racial and ethnic groups agree that race should not be a factor in college admissions , white adults are particularly likely to hold this view : 78 % say this , compared with 65 % of Hispanics , 62 % of blacks and 58 % of Asians .
The December 2017 survey asked people if they were active in 10 specific types of community groups and organizations : church groups , hobby groups , charitable or volunteer organizations , professional associations , community groups , book clubs , parent groups or youth organizations , social clubs , performing arts groups and veterans ' groups . It also gave respondents the chance to say they are involved in some `` other '' type of group or organization ( beyond the ones listed above ) .
Republicans are divided ideologically over stricter environmental regulations . Among the roughly two-thirds of Republicans and Republican leaners who describe their political views as conservative , 60 % say stricter laws cost too many jobs and hurt the economy . Among the party 's moderates and liberals ( who make up about a third of all Republicans and GOP leaners ) , 60 % say stricter environmental laws are worth the cost .
More broadly , about half ( 51 % ) of Americans are at least somewhat confident in Trump 's ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements with other countries . Public views of Trump in this domain are more positive than in many other areas . ( However , global trade ranks among the lowest concerns for the public 's policy priorities for 2019 .
Survey experiments also may involve randomizing specific details within a question to better understand nuances in views . For example , a report about Americans ' views about elections included a question that described a hypothetical election with 1 million voters in which one person voted even though they were not eligible to do so . Around four-in-ten Americans ( 41 % ) said this would be a `` major problem .
Both McConnell and Schumer draw positive ratings from members of their own parties . Still , fewer than half of Republican and Republican-leaning independent voters ( 46 % ) say they have warm feelings toward McConnell , while about a quarter rate him coldly ( 26 % ) and 28 % offer a neutral score of 50 on the thermometer . Schumer 's ratings among Democrats and Democratic leaners are similar : 46 % warm , 26 % cold , 27 % neutral .
Among Democrats , however , news interest plays a large role in whether they feel misunderstood . About a quarter of Democrats who are very interested in the news feel misunderstood ( 27 % ) , compared with about four-in-ten of the somewhat interested ( 39 % ) and roughly half of those not interested ( 52 % ) . Still , Democrats at all levels of news interest are much less likely than Republicans to feel misunderstood by the news media .
Those who say it is never acceptable to use an anonymous source are roughly three times as likely to say it has a great deal of influence on whether they think a story is credible ( 49 % vs. 15 % of those who say it is acceptable in special cases and 14 % of those who say always acceptable ) . Still , majorities of all three groups say that an anonymous source has at least some influence on their trust in a story .
Ukraine is an overwhelmingly Orthodox Christian nation , with nearly eight-in-ten adults ( 78 % ) identifying as Orthodox ( compared with 71 % in Russia ) , according to a 2015 Pew Research Center survey of much of the country ( some contested areas in eastern Ukraine were not surveyed ) . This is up from 39 % who said they were Orthodox Christian in 1991 – the year the officially atheist Soviet Union collapsed and Ukraine gained its independence . With roughly 35 million Orthodox Christians , Ukraine now has the third-largest Orthodox population in the world , after Russia and Ethiopia .
Voters approached the 2018 midterm elections with some trepidation about the voting process and many had concerns that U.S. election systems may be hacked . After the election , however , most say it was `` very easy '' to vote and confidence in election security has increased . About three-quarters of those who report casting ballots in the midterm elections ( 76 % ) say that voting was `` very easy .
White and black voters are more likely to say they turned out to vote on Election Day than beforehand ( 56 % of white voters and 59 % of black voters say they voted on Election Day ) . About half of Hispanic voters report voting on Election Day , while half say they voted early ( 49 % vs. 50 % ) .
Just 3 % of self-reported voters in the 2018 election say it was the first time they had ever voted ; 97 % say they had participated in elections before this year .

Among whites , 4.1 % are foreign-born today , but that share is projected to double to 8.1 % in 2060 .
Roughly one-third of Canadians ( 35 % ) view their neighbor to the south positively . A similar share across Europe holds this view ( median of 33 % ) , though favorable opinions range from a low of roughly a quarter in Belgium ( 24 % ) and Germany ( 26 % ) to a high of about four-in-ten or more in the UK ( 41 % ) and Italy ( 45 % ) .
Yet the share who says they are very confident in Donald Trump ( 22 % ) is substantially higher than the shares saying this for either Republican leaders ( 9 % ) or Democratic leaders ( 11 % ) in Congress . But the public is also more likely to say they are `` not at all confident '' in Trump 's decision making on tax policy ( 42 % ) than to say this about either party 's leaders in Congress ( 31 % say this about GOP leaders , 24 % about Democratic leaders ) .
About half of Americans ( 54 % ) say the budget deficit is a very serious problem for the country right now ; 35 % say it is a somewhat serious problem , while 10 % say it is a not too or not at all serious problem right now . While this is similar to public opinion on this question in CBS News/New York Times surveys conducted in 2003 , 2004 and 2005 , far greater shares of Americans said the budget deficit was a serious problem for the country in 2010 and 2011 . For example , in June 2011 , 75 % said the deficit was a very serious problem .
About half of the public ( 48 % ) says life for future generations of Americans will be worse than life today , while a quarter ( 25 % ) say it will be better and a similar share ( 26 % ) say it will be about the same . Within nearly all major demographic and political groups , more say life will be worse for future generations than say it will be better . Younger adults are somewhat more likely than older adults to say life will be better for future generations .
The Center 's survey found other indications that gun owners are more politically engaged than non-gun owners . For example , while only 16 % of U.S. adults say they 've ever given money to an organization that takes a position on gun policy , gun owners are again more likely than non-gun owners to say they have done so . Among gun owners , 28 % say they have ever given money to an organization like this , including 12 % of who have done so in the past year .
Seven-in-ten Democrats ( 70 % ) and 65 % of independents regard the economic system as unfair . Republicans are divided : 49 % say the system unfairly favors powerful interests , while 47 % say it is fair to most Americans . Majorities across income categories view the system as unfair .
Democrats , regardless of ideology , support higher tax rates on corporations . But while 70 % of liberal Democrats say tax rates on household incomes over $ 250,000 should be raised , fewer than half of conservative and moderate Democrats ( 46 % ) say the same .
More than twice as many Republicans view Netanyahu favorably ( 53 % ) as unfavorably ( 21 % ) ; 26 % have no opinion . By contrast , Democrats hold mixed views of Netanyahu ( 28 % favorable vs. 35 % unfavorable ) ; 37 % have no opinion . Independents ' opinions of Netanyahu mirror those of the overall public ( 38 % favorable , 26 % unfavorable , 36 % no opinion ) .
The number of Hispanics who speak Spanish at home is at an all-time high , though growth is slowing . A record 37 million Hispanics ages 5 and older speak Spanish at home , up from 25 million in 2000 . However , between 2010 and 2015 , this number grew at an annual average of 1.8 % , down from an annual average of 3.4 % between 2000 and 2010 .
Among adults who have never been married but say they are open to marrying in the future , about six-in-ten ( 59 % ) say that a major reason they are not married is that they have n't found the right person . An additional 13 % say this is a minor reason they are not married today . Majorities across a range of demographic groups cite this as a major reason why they are not married .
Drop-off voters reported less outreach from political candidates and campaigns than did consistent voters . Only about half of drop-off voters ( 51 % ) said they had ever been personally contacted to vote for a candidate , compared with 70 % of consistent voters .
As for types of games that Americans like to play , strategy and puzzle games are the most popular among those included in the survey . About six-in-ten adults who say they play video games often or sometimes report that they typically play these types of games ( 62 % each ) . Adventure , shooter , role-playing , team sport or racing and simulation games are all somewhat less commonly played , with about half of video game players or fewer saying they typically play these types of games .
Six-in-ten adults say the public K-12 education system has a lot of responsibility in making sure the U.S. workforce has the right skills and education to be successful in today 's economy , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in association with the Markle Foundation in 2016 . The only entity or institution that more people say has a lot of responsibility is `` individuals themselves , '' cited by 72 % of adults . Americans express a bit more ambivalence toward the role of colleges and universities in workforce preparation , with around half of adults ( 52 % ) saying these higher-education institutions should have a lot of responsibility in making sure workers have the right skills and education to succeed .
Around the world , few people trust Russian President Vladimir Putin to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs . A global median of roughly one-in-four ( 26 % ) say they have confidence in the Russian leader . Doubts about Putin 's handling of foreign policy , however , do not necessarily coincide with perceptions of Russia as a security risk .
Both Muslims and the general public also were asked if there are circumstances under which targeting and killing civilians can be justified in order to further a political , social or religious cause . Roughly eight-in-ten U.S. Muslims ( 84 % ) say such tactics can rarely ( 8 % ) or never ( 76 % ) be justified . The share of Muslims who say such tactics can often or sometimes be justified ( 12 % ) is similar to the share saying this among the general public ( 14 % ) .
Overall , 44 % of Americans now say that it is a lot more difficult to be a Black person in the U.S. than it is to be a White person , while 32 % say it is a little more difficult and 23 % say it is no more difficult . The share saying it is a lot more difficult to be Black than White is now 9 percentage points higher than it was in the summer of 2016 . But while overall views have shifted , the shift has come exclusively from within the Democratic coalition .
Across the 38 nations in the survey , a median of just 9 % view the countries of the EU as the world 's leading economic power . By comparison , 42 % name the U.S. and 32 % name China , while an additional 7 % name Japan .
Today , 72 % of Trump voters say that obstacles that once made it harder for women are now largely gone , up from 67 % in 2016 . By contrast , just 20 % of Biden voters currently say this – a modest decline from the 26 % among Clinton voters in 2016 .
At the same time , there is increased support for additional economic and diplomatic sanctions against Russia . Six-in-ten ( 60 % ) favor the U.S. increasing sanctions on Russia , while 34 % are opposed . Support for tougher sanctions against Russia has risen seven points from last April .
Democrats feel more negatively about talking politics with people who have a different opinion of the president than do Republicans . A large majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents – nearly seven-in-ten ( 68 % ) – say they find it to be stressful and frustrating to talk to people with different opinions of Trump . Among Republicans and Republican leaners , fewer ( 52 % ) say they find this to be stressful and frustrating .
Young adults – those younger than 35 – continue to be the most likely of all age groups to rent . In 2016 , 65 % of households headed by people younger than 35 were renting , up from 57 % in 2006 . Rental rates have also risen notably among those ages 35 to 44 .
Overall , eight-in-ten Americans say social media platforms are very ( 31 % ) or somewhat ( 49 % ) effective for raising public awareness about political or social issues , according to the survey of U.S. adults conducted July 13 - 19 . A similar share ( 77 % ) believes these platforms are at least somewhat effective for creating sustained social movements . Democrats and independents who lean Democratic are more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say social media sites are at least somewhat effective as a way to raise public awareness about political or social issues ( 86 % vs. 74 % ) , create sustained social movements ( 82 % vs. 73 % ) and get elected officials to pay attention to issues ( 71 % vs. 59 % ) .
New arrivals who receive green cards , on the other hand , are far more likely to be sponsored by family members – fully 85 % are , compared with 46 % of those who adjusted their status in 2015 . Only 4 % of new arrivals came in an employment category . Green card holders who adjusted their status are more likely than new arrivals to be in the prime working years of 25 to 64 , and are less likely to be younger or older .
Among non-gun owners , mothers are much more likely than fathers to say they have talked with their children about gun safety ( 58 % vs. 37 % ) . And while 59 % of white parents who do n't own guns say they have talked with their children about gun safety , 40 % of nonwhite parents who do n't own guns say they have done this .
Partisan divisions over gun policy proposals may reflect contrasting views among Republicans and Democrats on gun violence in the country today and on the impact of access to guns on crime and mass shootings . Though clear majorities of both Republicans ( 74 % ) and Democrats ( 92 % ) consider gun violence to be at least a moderately big problem in the U.S. , a much greater share of Democrats ( 65 % ) than Republicans ( 32 % ) say gun violence is a `` very big '' problem in the country .
By contrast , smaller religious groups may not have been harassed in as many countries simply because they are not present in as many countries . For instance , because of their dense concentration in a small number of countries , 99 % of Jews and Hindus lived in nations where members of their groups were harassed . And despite being one of the most geographically dispersed religious groups , 97 % of Muslims lived in countries where harassment of Muslims occurred in 2015 .
Support for the transatlantic security partnership is similar in Canada , the other North American member of NATO . Nearly two-thirds of Canadians ( 66 % ) hold NATO in high esteem . Such support has improved by 10 percentage points since 2015 .
People in emerging and developing countries around the world are on balance unhappy with the way their political systems are working . A recent Pew Research Center survey finds that , across 31 emerging and developing nations , a median of 52 % are dissatisfied with their political system , while 44 % are satisfied . Discontent is particularly widespread in the Middle East and Latin America , where about six-in-ten say their system is not working well .
There is somewhat more change among political independents than among partisans . However , 78 % of those who did not identify as Republicans or Democrats in December 2015 also did not affiliate with either party in March 2017 . Among the remaining 22 % , nearly equal shares ended up identifying as Democrats ( 12 % ) and Republicans ( 10 % ) .
There are also sizable differences in views about this issue by age , with younger adults ages 18 to 29 especially likely ( 66 % ) to see government regulations as necessary . Seniors 65 and older , however , think the private marketplace is the most effective way to increase reliance on renewable energy sources by a 50 % -41 % margin . Differences by age hold even when accounting for the tendency of older adults to identify with the GOP .
Support for the goals of the science marches is divided by political party . Republicans and Republican leaners oppose the goals of the science marches by a 47 % -25 % margin ; some 29 % are undecided about their views . Democrats and Democratic leaners support the goals of the marches by a 68 % -14 % margin , with 18 % undecided .
Here , too , there are differences in views by party and age . Fully 68 % of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents think there has been too much media coverage of demonstrations , while 18 % think the amount of coverage has been about right and 11 % say there has been too little coverage . By contrast , 43 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners think there has been the right amount of coverage , 29 % think there has been too little and 26 % say there has been too much media coverage of demonstrations these days .
A similar pattern to those seen with the urban-rural and racial composition of each district emerges in the relationship between the partisan leanings of a district and deaths attributable to the coronavirus . In the early stages of the pandemic , the hardest hit districts were overwhelmingly `` blue '' parts of the country . COVID-19 deaths in the March through May period were more than four times as high in strongly Democratic districts ( where Republican congressional candidates received less than 25 % of the vote in the 2018 midterm elections ) as in districts where Republican candidates won more than 60 % of the 2018 vote .
Half of Democratic voters in 2018 had a four-year college degree or more , compared with 35 % of Republican voters . Voters with postgraduate degrees made up nearly a quarter ( 24 % ) of the Democratic electorate , compared with 13 % among Republican voters . Combining this with the racial profile of the parties ' supporters , 57 % of GOP voters were White adults with no college degree , compared with 28 % among Democratic voters .
Sub-Saharan Africans ( a median of 68 % ) , Middle Easterners ( 61 % ) and Asians ( 57 % ) also report that those in the upper echelons of society have too much political influence . There are only two countries in the survey where fewer than four-in-ten believe the wealthy wield too much power – China ( 38 % ) and Vietnam ( 37 % ) , two nations still ruled by officially Communist parties . Roughly a quarter in both countries believe the rich should have more influence on their political system than they currently do .
The public continues to express frustration with the federal government , rather than anger or contentment . A majority of Americans say frustration ( 55 % ) best describes their feeling toward the federal government , while about two-in-ten say they are angry ( 22 % ) ; a similar share ( 19 % ) say they are basically content . Overall , attitudes toward the federal government today are virtually identical to a year ago .
Overall , 41 % say they have quite a lot of confidence in the future of the U.S. , while another 30 % say they have some confidence . About three-in-ten ( 28 % ) say they have very little or no confidence at all in the future of the U.S .
All citizen panelists – whether voters or nonvoters – were asked which U.S. House candidate they supported in the general election . Nonvoters tend to express more uncertainty about the choice , owing in large part to the fact that many of them pay little attention to politics . But among those who did express a preference , Democratic candidates led Republican candidates by 14 percentage points ( 44 % to 30 % ) a larger margin than among voters ( 9 points , 53 % to 44 % ) .
The public expresses broadest support for increased federal spending on veterans benefits . Overall , 75 % say that , if they were making up the budget for the federal government this year , they would increase spending on veterans benefits and services ; 21 % say they would keep spending the same , while just 3 % would decrease spending . On a range of other programs , there is widespread public support for either increasing spending or maintaining it at current levels .
These policy debates are occurring at a time when roughly nine-in-ten Americans describe high-speed internet service as either essential ( 49 % ) or important but not essential ( 41 % ) . Only about one-in-ten Americans say that high-speed internet access is either not too important ( 6 % ) or not important at all ( 3 % ) . Republicans and Democrats tend to agree that broadband is important , but Democrats are more likely to say it is essential : 58 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners describe broadband in this way , compared with 38 % of Republicans and Republican leaners .
However , when it comes to concerns about North Korea 's nuclear arsenal , there is a slight partisan difference . Roughly three-quarters of Republicans ( 74 % ) are very concerned about the weapons program , compared with 66 % of Democrats . There is a larger division by age on concern about the North 's nukes .
About one-in-six adults ( 16 % ) who have been employed in the past two years say there was a time during this period when they needed or wanted to take time off from work following the birth or adoption of their child , to care for a family member with a serious health condition or to deal with their own serious health condition , but were unable to do so . This figure rises to 30 % among those with household incomes under $ 30,000 .
Majority says significant changes are needed in structure of government . A 62 % majority of the public says that significant changes are needed in the fundamental design and structure of American government to make it work for current times ; 37 % say the design and structure of government serves the country well , and significant changes are not needed . While views among the public overall have changed little since 2018 , Democrats and Republicans have moved further apart in their opinions .
Irish and Scotch-Irish Americans are most highly concentrated in a few areas of the country , reflecting their historical migration patterns . The poor Irish immigrants who fled their famine-stricken homeland in the 1840s and 1850s generally settled in or close to the Northeastern port cities where they first arrived . New England states continue to have the highest share of residents claiming Irish ancestry : Massachusetts ( 21.6 % ) , New Hampshire ( 21.0 % ) , Rhode Island ( 18.3 % ) , Vermont ( 17.9 % ) and Maine ( 17.6 % ) .
Divisions along party lines also exist in Latinos ' views about the Obama administration . Two-thirds ( 66 % ) of Latino Democrats say his administration 's accomplishments will be better remembered than its failures . By contrast , 59 % of Latino Republicans say the failures will outweigh accomplishments .
Younger Americans have long been less likely to read newspapers than their elders . But a Pew Research Center survey has revealed a significant twist , at least for certain newspapers with a more national focus : When we asked people if they regularly got news about the 2016 presidential election through either the print or online version of four specific U.S. newspapers , three of these papers – The New York Times , The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal – attracted more adults younger than 50 than 50 and older as regular readers . As for the fourth – USA Today – younger and older Americans regularly got election news there at about the same rate .
Adults younger than 30 are also much more likely to have a favorable view of unions than of corporations ( 75 % vs. 55 % ) . Those in older age groups have similar opinions of unions and corporations . Roughly two-thirds ( 65 % ) of those with family incomes of $ 75,000 or more a year have a positive view of corporations , while smaller shares of those with incomes of $ 30,000- $ 74,999 ( 54 % ) and less than $ 30,000 ( 51 % ) say the same .
By a two-to-one margin , Republicans and Republican-leaning independents ages 50 and older have an unfavorable view of labor unions ( 64 % unfavorable , 32 % favorable ) . By contrast , a majority of younger Republicans ( 55 % ) express a favorable opinion toward unions ; 43 % view them unfavorably . Nearly three-quarters ( 72 % ) of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents with a college degree say they have a negative view of labor unions , while only 28 % are favorable toward labor .
While the general sentiment among police that the media treat them unfairly is shared across gender , racial and ethnic lines , some officers feel more strongly about it than others . White officers ( 43 % ) , for example , are more likely than their black colleagues ( 34 % ) to strongly agree that the media treat police unfairly . Among Hispanic officers , 40 % strongly agree .
In December , a majority of the public ( 82 % ) also said Trump should be more cautious in `` the kinds of things he says and tweets '' once he becomes president . Just 15 % said there is no need for him to change .
Across the 14 countries surveyed , a median of 73 % say that their own country has done a good job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak . Just 27 % believe their country has handled it poorly . However , there is some variation by country on this assessment .
And nearly identical shares say conservative Christians ( 52 % ) and lobbyists in Washington , D.C. ( 36 % ) will gain influence in Trump 's presidency as said that about the Bush administration ( 51 % and 35 % , respectively ) . Far fewer thought conservative Christians and lobbyists would gain under Obama ( 21 % each ) . As noted , however , smaller shares expect children to gain influence in Trump 's presidency than said that about Obama , Bush or Clinton before they took office .
The public holds very different views of three world leaders : Vladimir Putin , Benjamin Netanyahu and Angela Merkel . By 69 % to 19 % more hold an unfavorable than favorable view of Russian President Vladimir Putin ; just 13 % do not offer a rating of him . Views of Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are mixed : 34 % view him favorably , while about as many ( 32 % ) view him unfavorably and 33 % are unable to offer a rating .
Angela Merkel is held in higher esteem by Democrats than Republicans . Overall , 38 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners view her favorably , while 18 % view her unfavorably and 44 % are unable to rate her . Among Republicans and Republican leaners , 31 % hold an unfavorable view of the German chancellor , compared with 22 % who have a favorable view and 47 % who do not offer a rating .
In the current survey , Republicans express confidence in Trump 's decision-making . Overall , 65 % say they think Trump 's approach to making important decisions will be about right ; roughly a quarter ( 28 % ) say he 'll be too impulsive . Conservative Republicans ( 74 % ) are more likely than moderate and liberal Republicans ( 51 % ) to say they think Trump 's decision-making will be about right .
Mormons are the most heavily Republican-leaning religious group in the U.S. , while a pair of major historically black Protestant denominations – the African Methodist Episcopal ( AME ) Church and the National Baptist Convention – are two of the most reliably Democratic groups , according to our February blog post based on data from Pew Research Center 's 2014 Religious Landscape Study .
The age divides are substantial : 68 % of registered voters ages 18 to 29 say the U.S. is successful more because of its ability to change . The share who express this view declines across each older age group — just 39 % of those ages 65 and older associate U.S. success more with the country 's ability to change , while 58 % attribute it more to the nation 's reliance on long-standing principles . White voters are divided over whether an ability to change ( 47 % ) or a reliance on long-standing principles ( 51 % ) has more to do with the nation 's success .
Assessments of Obama 's efforts to solve major problems also divide along racial , age and educational lines . Blacks ( 60 % ) are much more likely than whites ( 31 % ) or Hispanics ( 38 % ) to say Obama has made progress on the problems facing the nation . Though roughly even shares of whites and Hispanics say Obama has made progress on these issues , Hispanics are much more likely than whites to say Obama tried , but failed to make progress ( 45 % vs. 29 % ) , while whites are more likely than Hispanics to say he made these problems worse ( 26 % vs. 8 % ) .
When it comes to climate change and evolution , a majority of adults see scientists as generally in agreement that the earth is getting warmer due to human activity ( 57 % ) or that humans have evolved over time ( 66 % ) , though a sizeable minority see scientists as divided over each . Perceptions of where the scientific community stands on both climate change and evolution tend to be associated with individual views on the issue .
In December 2008 , 71 % of Americans approved of Barack Obama 's cabinet choices , and 58 % expressed positive views of George W. Bush 's high-level appointments in January 2001 , prior to his inauguration . Similarly , higher shares approved of the way that both Obama ( 72 % ) and Bush ( 50 % ) explained their policies and plans for the future than say that about Trump today .
A new Pew Research Center survey finds that , for the most part , the large majority of Americans do not feel that information overload is a problem for them . Some 20 % say they feel overloaded by information , a decline from the 27 % figure from a decade ago , while 77 % say they like having so much information at their fingertips . Two-thirds ( 67 % ) say that having more information at their disposals actually helps to simplify their lives .
Three-in-ten Americans ( 30 % ) say research on GM foods is often based on the best available evidence . An equal share of U.S. adults say desires of scientists to help their industries influence research findings on GM foods most of the time ; half ( 50 % ) of the public says this occurs some of the time . A 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering and Medicine suggests there is consensus among scientific experts that GM foods are safe .
In Pew Research Center 's post-election survey , conducted Nov. 10 - 14 , more than half of Trump supporters ( 55 % ) said they have confidence in the new president to `` do the right thing '' when it comes to illegal immigration . Trump scored higher among his supporters on two other issues ( the economy and the threat of terrorism ) , and about the same on a third ( health care ) .
Many singles are open to dating someone who is different from them , but certain characteristics would give some people pause . Distance , debt and voting for Donald Trump top the list of reasons singles looking for a relationship would n't consider a potential partner , but there are other considerations , too . For example , 38 % say dating someone 10 years older than them would give them pause , and 36 % say the same about dating someone who is raising children from another relationship .
The demographic profile of veterans is also expected to change in the coming decades , reflecting the shifting demographic profile of the military in general . Between 2013 and 2043 , the share of all veterans who are women will almost double , from 9 % up to 17 % , according to VA projections . At the same time , the share ages 50 to 69 is expected to shrink from 42 % to 34 % , while the share ages 70 or older is expected to rise from 30 % to 36 % .
Overall , relatively few voters thought the country had made progress on most issues since 2008 . The economy was the only one of seven about which roughly as many voters said things had gotten better ( 38 % ) as worse ( 43 % ) over this period . Roughly two-in-ten ( 18 % ) thought it has stayed about the same .
Immigrants in the U.S. as a whole have lower levels of education than the U.S.-born population . In 2018 , immigrants were over three times as likely as the U.S. born to have not completed high school ( 27 % vs. 8 % ) . However , immigrants were just as likely as the U.S. born to have a bachelor 's degree or more ( 32 % and 33 % , respectively ) .
There is , however , an age divide among Trump backers . Trump voters ages 18 - 34 are less likely than older Trump supporters to say they have a hard time respecting a Clinton supporter ( 29 % of those under 35 say this , compared with 45 % of Trump backers 65 and older ) .
Their positive take on the U.S. does not keep the Japanese from taking a pessimistic view of their long-time ally 's trajectory on the world stage . About six-in-ten ( 61 % ) say the United States plays a less important and powerful role as a world leader today compared with 10 years ago . Just 7 % believe the U.S. plays a more important role , while 29 % say Washington is as important as a decade ago .
Although nearly half of married Americans say shared religious beliefs are very important to a successful marriage , considerably fewer ( 27 % ) say the religion of their spouse was a very important factor in their choosing who to marry . Another 21 % say their spouse 's religion was `` somewhat '' important in their decision to wed. Again , those who are married to someone in the same religious group are more likely than religiously intermarried people to say their spouse 's faith tradition was an important factor in their decision marry them . A majority of those married to someone of the same faith say this was a very ( 36 % ) or somewhat ( 26 % ) important element in their choice , while most of those who are married to someone with a different religious identity ( including people in marriages between a religiously affiliated person and a religious `` none '' ) say their spouse 's religion was not an important factor .
Some 55 % of working Ph.D. scientists belonging to the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) who we surveyed in 2014 said this was generally a good time for their scientific specialty , while 44 % said it was a bad time . And while nearly half ( 47 % ) said it was a good or very good time to begin a career in their field , 53 % said it was a bad time to start out in their field .
Clinton supporters ( 60 % ) are more likely than Trump supporters ( 51 % ) to view a concession as very important . Only about one in five of each candidate 's supporters ( 21 % of Trump backers , 16 % of Clinton backers ) say this is not important . By contrast , roughly twice as many Johnson and Stein supporters ( 41 % ) think it is not too or not at all important that the losing candidate publicly acknowledge the winner as the legitimate president .
Most supporters of both Clinton ( 62 % ) and Trump ( 59 % ) have only been contacted on behalf of the candidate they plan to vote for . In part this reflects the effectiveness of modern campaigns in targeting their mobilization efforts to those who support their candidate . About a third of Trump supporters ( 32 % ) and a quarter of Clinton backers ( 27 % ) have been reached by efforts on behalf of both campaigns , while very few have only been contacted on behalf of the candidate they do not back .
Not surprisingly , responses are sharply divided along partisan lines . Two-thirds of Republican voters ( 66 % ) say Trump would do an excellent or good job helping workers get the training they need , while only 6 % of Democratic voters agree . Even so , a significant minority of Republicans ( 30 % ) say Trump would do only a fair or poor job at this .
The United States , another principal actor on the world stage , gets mixed reviews in China . Half give the U.S. a favorable rating , while 44 % offer a negative one . But 52 % think the U.S. is trying to prevent China from becoming an equal power ; only 29 % believe the U.S. is willing to accept China 's rise .
Among all Christian religious traditions in the U.S. , Mormons are among the most highly involved in their congregations ( 67 % ) , according to an analysis based on three measures of congregational involvement : membership in a congregation , frequency of attendance at worship services and frequency of attendance at small group religious activities . Jehovah 's Witnesses have comparable levels of highly involved members ( 64 % ) , while evangelical Protestants ( 43 % ) , members of historically black Protestant denominations ( 41 % ) and those in other Christian groups have lower average levels of congregational involvement .

Evangelicals cite other reasons for supporting him beyond opposition to Clinton . Roughly one-third of evangelical Trump supporters also pointed to his issue positions as the main reason they support him , and about one-quarter ( 26 % ) mentioned his status as a political outsider who will bring change to the political system as a reason for backing him . One-in-five said they support him because of his personality and `` tell-it-like-it-is '' style .
Large majorities say Beijing poses serious challenges for India . Seven-in-ten of those surveyed believe that China 's economic impact on India is a serious problem , including 45 % who voice the view that it is very serious .
