   "summary": "More than half of the world 's population identify as feminists - in india alone , over 80 percent of respondents very much or somewhat agreed that they defined themselves as feminists . Surprisingly , this number is much lower in developed countries like the united states or germany ( with not even 40 percent of respondents agreeing ) , which might be due to the bad reputation feminism - wrongfully \u2013 has . But are some really more equal than others ? Despite its deceptive title , feminism is not about establishing superiority of women \u2013 its core concept is equality for all , no matter their sex , gender , or orientation .\n",
