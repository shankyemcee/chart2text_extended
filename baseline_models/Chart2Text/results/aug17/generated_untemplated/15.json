   "gold": "Production of natural gas in the United States has been increasing for the past decade and amounted to 831.8 billion cubic meters in 2018 . An increase in production corresponded with rising demand for natural gas in the United States , particularly after the 2008 Recession . Natural gas becomes competitive Since the early 2000s , the price of coal had been going up , and increased more rapidly following the 2008 Recession , which affected the cost of crude oil to an even greater degree .\n"
