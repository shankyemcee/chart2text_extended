   "gold": "This statistic compares the pass rates for men and women in driving theory tests in the United Kingdom ( UK ) between 2007/08 and 2018/19 . Women consistently performed better than men at the theory tests by around six percent . Although the pass rates have been falling , the most recent drop can possibly be attributed , in part , to new , previously unpublished questions being used in the new tests .\n"
