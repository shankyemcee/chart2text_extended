   "gold": "Inflation in Zimbabwe rose to 10.6 percent in 2018 , and is projected to jump dramatically to 161.81 percent in 2019 . After that , estimates predict a 3 percent equilibrium for now - however , given Zimbabwe 's history of poor monetary policy , including one of the worst instances of hyperinflation , this seems unrealistic . Inflation history Inflation depends significantly on economic expectations of it , making it hard to reduce inflation once it has hit higher levels .\n"
