   "gold": "Today , the vast majority of the world uses what is known as the Gregorian calendar , Named after Pope Gregory XIII , who introduced it in 1582 . The Gregorian calendar replaced the Julian calendar , which had been the most used calendar in Europe until this point . The Gregorian calendar lasts for approximately 365.24 days ; this means that most years have 365 days , with one extra day being added every fourth year , unless the year is divisible by 100 but not 400 ( for example , the year 2000 was a leap year , whereas 2100 and 2200 will not be ) .\n"
