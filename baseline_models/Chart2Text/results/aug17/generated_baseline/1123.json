   "gold": "In the 2019 United Kingdom General Election , voter turnout was 67.3 percent of eligible voters , a 1.5 percent drop compared with the previous general election in 2017 . Between 1922 and 1997 voter turnout never fell below 70 percent , but in 2001 it dropped to just 59.4 percent . Since that low point , voter turnout has gradually recovered and reached 72.2 percent in the Brexit Referendum of 2016 , which is still some way off the peak of 83.9 percent recorded in the 1950 General Election .\n"
