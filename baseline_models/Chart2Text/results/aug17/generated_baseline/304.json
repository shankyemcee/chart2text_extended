The Italian car brand was followed by Volkswagen ( roughly 177 thousand passenger cars sold ) and Ford ( approximately 123 thousand units ) . Small cars drive passenger car sales in Italy ... Overall car sales in Italy showed a positive trend in recent years until 2018 , when a decrease of about three percent on the previous year was observed .\n"
