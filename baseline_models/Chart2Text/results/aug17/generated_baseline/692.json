This was an increase in comparison to the previous year , but significantly lower than for example in 2010 and 2011 , when the migration balance was 79,446 and 62,157 respectively . It was also considerably lower than in neighboring country the Netherlands , which in 2018 had a positive migration balance of over 86,000 .\n"
