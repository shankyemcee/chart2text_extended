Following the financial crisis , the services sector grew to just over 64 percent in 2009 , but otherwise has made up a consistent share of GDP . Industry was hit the hardest in 2009 , dropping just below a quarter of total GDP , while agriculture has been below one percent since the early 2000s .\n"
