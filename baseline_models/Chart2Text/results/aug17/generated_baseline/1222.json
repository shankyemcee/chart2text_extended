   "gold": "Canada 's carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel and cement production reached about 568 million metric tons in 2018 , compared to 494 million metric tons in 1995 . A large percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions ( GHG ) are derived from the production and consumption of energy . In Canada , energy-related emissions account for an even higher share of total emissions due to extreme temperatures , large land area , and dispersed populations .\n"
