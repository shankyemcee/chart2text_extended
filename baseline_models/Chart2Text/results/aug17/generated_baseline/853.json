   "gold": "Inflation in Argentina was 34 percent in 2018 , expected to rise to nearly 44 percent the following year before declining to 6 percent by 2024 . A major factor in this is the legacy of poor fiscal discipline left by the economic depression from 1998 to 2002 . What causes inflation ? Inflation is a rise in price levels for all goods .\n"
