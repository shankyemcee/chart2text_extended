   "gold": "This statistic represents the energy costs of lighting a six-foot Christmas tree , lit 12 hours a day for 40 days , decorated with various light types . Americans choosing not to burn down their house during Christmas season should stay away from real candles anyway , and if they also prefer spending their money on Christmas presents instead of the Christmas tree decoration , LED lights are the best choice - decorating the tree with 280 LED lights for 40 days costs only 0.61 U.S. dollars .\n"
