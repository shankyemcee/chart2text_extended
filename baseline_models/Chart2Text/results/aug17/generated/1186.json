   "gold": "During the period between 1931 and 1960 , the number of live births in the United Kingdom peaked in 1947 , where there were estimated to have been over one million births . By contrast , the year with the least births was 1941 when there were just 695 thousand births . These two figures are undoubtedly linked to the Second World War , with 1941 coming just after the Battle of Britain and 1947 being two years after the end of the war .\n"
