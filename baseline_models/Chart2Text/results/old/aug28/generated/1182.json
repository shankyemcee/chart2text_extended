There were 701 homicides recorded in England and Wales in 2018/19 , slightly fewer than in the previous reporting year of 2017/18 , when there were 728 homicides . Between 2002/03 and 2013/14 the number of homicides in England and Wales almost halved from over 1 thousand to just over 530 . The recent rise in the number of homicides has occurred alongside an increase in the overall number of crimes , with police officials linking this to long-term cuts to their manpower and resources .\n"
