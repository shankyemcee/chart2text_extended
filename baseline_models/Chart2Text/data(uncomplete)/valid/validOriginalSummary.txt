Indeed , when it comes to explaining partisanship , income is not nearly as powerful a factor as the familiar stereotype would suggest . To find out its relative influence , Pew conducted a multiple regression analysis of survey data it has collected on party identification since January of 2004 . This is a statistical technique that measures the relative impact of each of a set of factors on a phenomenon of interest . The analysis ( see table ) shows that of six demographic traits often linked to partisanship , race is the most influential driver of party identification , and frequency of church attendance is the second most important . Income , union membership and gender are of roughly equal importance , and education is least important .
That survey found that about half of Indian Americans ( 51 % ) identify as Hindus , while 5 % identify as Sikhs and 2 % as Jains ( two other religious groups that also observe Diwali ) . Most of the rest are Christians ( 18 % ) , Muslims ( 10 % ) or people unaffiliated with any religion ( 10 % ) .
There are differences in these patterns by community type and parents ' education level . Roughly two-thirds of students attending suburban schools ( 65 % ) say they use the internet for homework every day or almost every day , compared with 58 % who attend schools in cities , 50 % of those who attend in rural areas and 44 % of those attending schools in towns . Students whose parents graduated from college are more likely to use the internet for homework at home . Some 62 % of these students use the internet at home for homework , compared with smaller shares of students whose parents have some post-high school education ( 53 % ) , have only a high school education ( 52 % ) or have no high school education ( 48 % ) .
Compared with other Christian groups analyzed in the data , Catholics were about as likely as White Protestants who are not evangelical ( 60 % ) and Black Protestants ( 64 % ) to support legal abortion , and much more likely than White evangelical Protestants ( 20 % ) to do so . Among Americans who are religiously unaffiliated – those who say they are atheist , agnostic or `` nothing in particular '' – the vast majority ( 83 % ) said abortion should be legal in all or most cases .
In both parties , there are ideological differences in views of whether conversations with those they disagree with politically are stressful or not . Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents , 63 % of liberals say such conversations are stressful and frustrating , compared with 51 % of conservatives and moderates .
The survey also asks people about whether voting this year will be easy or difficult . A large majority ( 84 % ) of those who plan to vote in the midterms say voting will be easy , though fewer than half ( 44 % ) say they expect it will be very easy . About one-in-seven people ( 15 % ) who plan to vote say it will be difficult .
A near-consensus of Democratic voters say climate change is a problem for the U.S . Among Democratic registered voters ( including those who lean to the Democratic Party ) who support any of the five leading candidates for their party 's nomination as of mid-January , more than nine-in-ten say climate change is at least a moderately big problem for the country today – including three-quarters or more who say it 's a very big problem . There are some differences in voters ' degree of concern : Joe Biden and Michael Bloomberg supporters are slightly less likely to describe climate change as a very big problem , compared with supporters of other candidates . As with other issues related to climate and the environment , the partisan divide on this question is large : Just 41 % of Republican registered voters ( including those who lean to the GOP ) say climate change is a moderately or very big problem for the country .
The age divides are substantial : 68 % of registered voters ages 18 to 29 say the U.S. is successful more because of its ability to change . The share who express this view declines across each older age group — just 39 % of those ages 65 and older associate U.S. success more with the country 's ability to change , while 58 % attribute it more to the nation 's reliance on long-standing principles . White voters are divided over whether an ability to change ( 47 % ) or a reliance on long-standing principles ( 51 % ) has more to do with the nation 's success . However , majorities of Black ( 62 % ) and Hispanic ( 60 % ) voters say the country 's ability to change has more to do with its success .
Both Republicans and Democrats are about as likely to say that talking about politics with people whom they disagree with is `` stressful and frustrating '' as say such conversations are `` interesting and informative . '' And majorities in both parties ( 65 % of Republicans , 63 % of Democrats ) say that when they talk to people on the other side , they usually end up finding they have less in common politically than they thought .
Half of Democratic voters in 2018 had a four-year college degree or more , compared with 35 % of Republican voters . Voters with postgraduate degrees made up nearly a quarter ( 24 % ) of the Democratic electorate , compared with 13 % among Republican voters . Combining this with the racial profile of the parties ' supporters , 57 % of GOP voters were White adults with no college degree , compared with 28 % among Democratic voters .
There are generational differences on other science topics as well , including on childhood vaccines . Thirty-seven percent of adults under the age 50 say parents should be able to decide not to vaccinate their children , compared with 22 % of those ages 50 and older . And when it comes to the idea of changing a baby 's genetic characteristics in order to reduce the risk of serious diseases , 56 % of those ages 65 and older say this would be taking medical advances too far , compared with just 42 % of those ages 18 - 29 .
Over the same period , the share saying that too little attention is paid to race and racial issues also has risen . Today , 44 % say too little attention is paid to racial issues , while 32 % say there is too much focus on race ; 19 % say about the right amount of attention is paid to racial issues .
Nine-in-ten Israeli Druze say they have a strong sense of belonging to the Druze community and about the same number ( 93 % ) say they are proud to be Druze . Roughly two-thirds say they have a special responsibility to take care of Druze in need around the world . About seven-in-ten Druze ( 72 % ) say their religious identity is very important to them . But when asked if their Druze identity is mainly a matter of religion , culture or ancestry – or a combination of these elements – roughly eight-in-ten say being Druze is either essentially about ancestry or culture ( 33 % ) or a combination of religion and ancestry/culture ( 47 % ) . Only about one-in-five say being Druze is primarily a matter of religion ( 18 % ) . By comparison , more Israeli Christians ( 31 % ) and Israeli Muslims ( 45 % ) say being Christian/Muslim is mainly a matter of religion to them .
A new nationwide survey by the Pew Research Center 's Social & Demographic Trends project finds that a majority ( 54 % ) of workers ages 65 and older say the main reason they work is that they want to . Just 17 % say the main reason is that they need the paycheck . An additional 27 % say they 're motivated by a mix of desire and need .
Many Americans are skeptical that the advantages of economic globalization outweigh the disadvantages : 49 % of the public said in an April survey that U.S. involvement in the global economy is bad because it lowers wages and costs jobs . That compares with 44 % who said that global economic engagement is good because it opens new markets and creates opportunities for growth . The U.S. public 's divided worldview sharply contrasts with the overwhelming opinion among international relations ( IR ) scholars that America 's involvement in the world economy is good for the nation . In the latest of a series of online `` snap '' polls that ask university-based IR experts their opinion about current policy issues , the Teaching , Research , and International Policy ( TRIP ) Project early this month found that nearly nine-in-ten IR scholars ( 86 % ) see U.S. involvement in the global economy as a positive ; just 2 % of those in the poll say it is a bad thing . Individuals selected for the TRIP survey must be employed at a political science department or professional school of a U.S. college or university and teach or conduct research on issues that cross international borders .
Republican voters give the current field of presidential candidates higher ratings than at comparable times in the past two nomination contests . Nearly six-in-ten Republican and Republican-leaning voters ( 59 % ) say they have an excellent or good impression of their party 's hopefuls , according to a September survey . In August 2011 , half ( 49 % ) of Republican voters viewed the GOP presidential field positively ; in October 2007 , it was similar ( 50 % ) .
When it comes to which country is the world 's leading military power , more than eight-in-ten Americans agree that it 's the U.S. , up 11 percentage points since the question was last asked in 2016 . Only 6 % name China , a 6-point decrease . Similarly , few name Russia ( 8 % ) , a view largely unchanged since four years ago . Regardless of whether they think the U.S. is the leading economic or military power today , nearly all Americans also think that a future with U.S. leadership is a better thing than one with Chinese leadership . When forced to choose between which would be better for the world , 91 % of Americans say it is better for the U.S. to be the world 's leading power than China ( 4 % ) , largely unchanged since 2018 when the question was last asked . While there is widespread agreement across all groups in society , Republicans and those who see China 's power and influence as a major threat are more likely than Democrats and those who feel less threatened to value U.S. global leadership .
Although nearly half of married Americans say shared religious beliefs are very important to a successful marriage , considerably fewer ( 27 % ) say the religion of their spouse was a very important factor in their choosing who to marry . Another 21 % say their spouse 's religion was `` somewhat '' important in their decision to wed. Again , those who are married to someone in the same religious group are more likely than religiously intermarried people to say their spouse 's faith tradition was an important factor in their decision marry them . A majority of those married to someone of the same faith say this was a very ( 36 % ) or somewhat ( 26 % ) important element in their choice , while most of those who are married to someone with a different religious identity ( including people in marriages between a religiously affiliated person and a religious `` none '' ) say their spouse 's religion was not an important factor .
The public is much less certain on other aspects of gaming . Fully 47 % of all adults are unsure if most video games portray minorities poorly , while 40 % are unsure if most video games portray women poorly .
Six percent of online adults are reddit users,1 according to a nationally representative survey by the Pew Research Center 's Internet & American Life Project . This is our first survey that specifically examines reddit as a standalone platform , and it finds that young men are especially likely to visit the site . Some 15 % of male internet users ages 18 - 29 say that they use reddit , compared with 5 % of women in the same age range and 8 % of men ages 30 - 49 .
Most U.S. adults think human activity , such as the burning of fossil fuels , contributes a great deal ( 49 % ) or some ( 32 % ) to climate change . About two-in-ten ( 19 % ) say human activity contributes not too much or not at all to climate change . Views on this question are about the same as they were last fall .
New arrivals who receive green cards , on the other hand , are far more likely to be sponsored by family members – fully 85 % are , compared with 46 % of those who adjusted their status in 2015 . Only 4 % of new arrivals came in an employment category . Green card holders who adjusted their status are more likely than new arrivals to be in the prime working years of 25 to 64 , and are less likely to be younger or older . Among those who adjusted their status , 72 % were ages 25 to 64 , compared with 55 % of new arrivals .
Majorities of adults in each of the 11 emerging and developing countries surveyed report owning their own mobile phone . Ownership levels are highest in Vietnam , where nearly all adults ( 97 % ) own a mobile device , although about nine-in-ten or more also own one in Jordan , Tunisia , Colombia , Kenya , Lebanon and South Africa . Ownership is lowest in Venezuela , India and the Philippines , but even in these countries about seven-in-ten adults own a mobile device . Meanwhile , an 11-country median of 11 % say they do not own a mobile phone , which includes a median of 7 % who say they regularly use someone else 's phone .7 But overall , phone sharing is relatively rare in most countries – ranging from just 1 % in Vietnam to a high of 17 % in Venezuela . ( Throughout this report , phone owners and phone sharers will be grouped together and referred to as `` mobile phone users . '' )
Younger adults are considerably more likely to say the U.S. has handled the outbreak poorly than older ones . Around two-thirds of those under 30 ( 65 % ) say the U.S. has done a poor job , compared with 59 % of those ages 30 to 49 and only around four-in-ten of those 50 and older .
About one-in-four adults ( 26 % ) closely followed news about the economy last week , while an equal share closely followed news about how the rollout of the 2010 health care law was going . A smaller percentage of the public — 17 % —closely followed negotiations about a new budget deal in Congress . A week after the death of former South African President Nelson Mandela , one-in-five ( 20 % ) very closely followed his memorial service and other news about his death . Fully 54 % of non-Hispanic blacks followed news about Mandela very closely last week , compared with 14 % of non-Hispanic whites .
One aspect of personal risk for exposure to the coronavirus is whether someone is employed in a setting where they must have frequent contact with other people , such as at a grocery store , hospital or construction site . Given the potential for the spread of the coronavirus within households , risk to individuals is also higher if other members of the household are employed in similar settings . Among people who are currently employed full-time , 35 % are working in a job with frequent public contact . Among those working part-time , almost half work ( 48 % ) in such a setting . For those living in a household with other adults , 35 % report that at least one of those individuals is working in a job that requires frequent contact with other people .
Pairing a survey with an examination of the Twitter behaviors of U.S. adults also allows for a comparison of the attitudes and characteristics of political tweeters with those of other Twitter users . Political tweeters – defined as those who tweeted at least five times in total , and at least twice about national politics , over the year of the study period – are almost twice as likely as other Twitter users to say the people they follow on Twitter have political beliefs similar to their own ( 38 % of political tweeters say this , compared with around one-in-five among nonpolitical tweeters ) . By contrast , nonpolitical tweeters are more likely to say they are n't sure about the political beliefs of the people they follow or that they follow people with a mix of political views .
When asked how the government should provide health insurance coverage , 36 % of Americans say it should be provided through a single national government program , while 26 % say it should continue to be provided through a mix of private insurance companies and government programs . This is a change from about a year ago , when nearly equal shares supported a `` single payer '' health insurance program ( 30 % ) and a mix of government programs and private insurers ( 28 % ) .
Among adults who have never been married but say they are open to marrying in the future , about six-in-ten ( 59 % ) say that a major reason they are not married is that they have n't found the right person . An additional 13 % say this is a minor reason they are not married today . Majorities across a range of demographic groups cite this as a major reason why they are not married . About four-in-ten never-married adults ( 41 % ) who say they may want to marry in the future say that not being financially stable is a major reason they are not currently married , and 28 % point to this as a minor reason . Fewer – but still a substantial share – say that a major ( 24 % ) or minor ( 30 % ) reason they are not married is that they are n't ready to settle down .
The share of the U.S. population that is Hispanic has been steadily rising over the past half century . In 2015 , Hispanics made up 17.6 % of the total U.S. population , up from 3.5 % in 1960 . According to the latest Pew Research Center projections , the Hispanic share of the U.S. population is expected to reach 24 % by 2065 .
A 2018 Center survey found that some Facebook users had recently taken steps to moderate their use of the site – such as deleting the Facebook app from their phone or taking a break from the platform for some time . But despite these findings and amid some high profile controversies , Facebook users as a whole are just as active on the site today as they were a year ago . Roughly three-quarters of Facebook users ( 74 % ) visit the site daily , including about half who do so several times a day . These shares are identical to those reported by Facebook users in the Center 's 2018 social media use survey . Majorities of Snapchat and Instagram users also say they visit these sites daily , though they are slightly less likely than Facebook users to do so . The shares of young adults using these platforms daily are especially large . Roughly eight-in-ten Snapchat users ages 18 to 29 ( 77 % ) say they use the app every day , including 68 % who say they do so multiple times day . Similarly , 76 % of Instagram users in this age group visit the site on a daily basis , with 60 % reporting that they do so several times per day . These patterns are largely similar to what the Center found in 2018 . Other platforms are visited somewhat less frequently . Some 51 % of YouTube users say they visit the site daily – a slight increase from the 45 % who said this in 2018 .
Support for the transatlantic security partnership is similar in Canada , the other North American member of NATO . Nearly two-thirds of Canadians ( 66 % ) hold NATO in high esteem . Such support has improved by 10 percentage points since 2015 . This rise in support can be seen across demographic groups . Roughly three-quarters of Liberal Party ( 75 % ) and Conservative Party ( 74 % ) adherents have a positive view of the security alliance , as do about two-thirds of New Democratic Party ( 65 % ) loyalists . In Europe , the Poles ( 79 % ) and Dutch ( 79 % ) express the strongest support for NATO among the alliance members surveyed . In 2015 such sentiment stood at 74 % in Poland and 72 % in the Netherlands .
Our most recent panel survey , conducted Sept. 9-Oct. 3 with 3,154 adults — including 2,150 likely voters — checks back in with Americans interviewed for the political typology study . It finds that the two strongest Republican groups – the Business Conservatives and the Steadfast Conservatives – are more motivated to vote than other groups , with 67 % and 66 % , respectively , likely to turn out . Steadfast Conservatives are staunch critics of government and are socially conservative . Business Conservatives prefer limited government , but are far more moderate on social issues than Steadfast Conservatives and favor immigration reform . We estimate that these two groups constitute only 22 % of the general public , but because they are so engaged with politics , these groups make up 38 % of the likely electorate . On the left , the Solid Liberals are solidly Democratic in their vote preference ( 93 % ) among likely voters and are uniformly liberal across nearly every realm – government , the economy , business , the environment and foreign policy , as well as on social issues . But they are somewhat less likely than the two conservative groups to vote ; we forecasted that 54 % of them will turn out to vote .
Support for paid family and medical leave is widespread , but it is greater under some circumstances than others . About eight-in-ten Americans ( 82 % ) support paid leave for mothers following the birth or adoption of a child , while 69 % support paid paternity leave for fathers . And while 85 % support paid leave for workers dealing with their own serious health condition , fewer ( 67 % ) support paid leave for those caring for a family member who is seriously ill. More Americans say that employers , rather than the federal or state government , should be responsible for providing pay for workers who take leave . For example , roughly six-in-ten adults say employers should provide pay for workers who need to deal with their own serious health condition ( 62 % ) and for mothers following birth or adoption ( 61 % ) .
On views of the future international role of the European Union , a sizable majority of Americans believe the EU 's global standing will be unaffected by the crisis , while about a fifth believe it will increase or decrease , respectively .
These are among the major findings from a Pew Research Center survey conducted among 6,204 respondents in Israel , Jordan , Lebanon , Tunisia and Turkey from Feb. 27 to April 25 , 2017 . Middle Eastern publics see both the U.S. and Russia playing more important roles in the region today than they did 10 years ago . At least half in all of the nations surveyed say Russia is more influential now compared with a decade ago . Lebanon is particularly likely to say Russia 's role has grown , with Shia ( 81 % ) and Sunni Muslims ( 77 % ) sharing this view .
From ride-hailing apps to shopping services , the sharing and on-demand economy has grown in the U.S. , yet a relatively small minority of the public is incorporating shared and on-demand services deeply into their day-to-day lives . Still , some Americans are `` super users '' : 7 % have used six or more services ( out of a total of 11 ) , according to a Pew Research Center study .
A majority ( 55 % ) of U.S. mothers with children younger than 18 at home are employed full time , up from 34 % a half-century ago , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau Current Population Survey data . The rise in full-time employment has fueled the overall rise in employment among moms : Now , 72 % of moms are employed , either full time or part time , compared with about half in 1968 . Among fathers with kids in the home , the vast majority ( 89 % ) are employed full time .
The electorate in last year 's presidential election was the most racially and ethnically diverse in U.S. history , with nearly one-in-four votes cast by non-whites , according to a new analysis of Census Bureau data by the Pew Research Center .1 The nation 's three biggest minority groups—blacks , Hispanics and Asians—each accounted for unprecedented shares of the presidential vote in 2008 . Overall , whites2 made up 76.3 % of the record 131 million people3 who voted in November 's presidential election , while blacks made up 12.1 % , Hispanics 7.4 % and Asians 2.5 % .4 The white share is the lowest ever , yet is still higher than the 65.8 % white share of the total U.S. population ( Pew Hispanic Center , 2009 ) .
Young adults who do not have a college degree are delaying marriage to such an extent that the median age at first marriage in 2008 was , for the first time ever , the same for the college-educated and those who were not college-educated : 28 . As recently as 2000 , there had been a two-year gap , with the typical college-educated adult marrying for the first time at 28 and the typical adult lacking a college degree marrying for the first time at 26 .
Democrats divided on how far to go in investigating Trump administration . With the Democratic Party now in control of House committees , Democrats are divided on whether they are more concerned congressional Democrats will focus too much – or not enough – in investigating the Trump administration . About half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents ( 51 % ) say their bigger concern is that Democrats in Congress will not focus enough on investigating the administration ; nearly as many ( 46 % ) say their bigger concern is they will focus too much on investigations .
Foreign-born workers , who now comprise 15 % of the U.S. labor force , made notable progress into middle- and high-wage jobs between 1995 and 2005 . During this period , many foreign-born Latinos stepped out of the low-wage workforce and headed toward the middle of the wage distribution . In particular , newly arrived Hispanics proved much less likely to be low-wage workers in 2005 than in 1995 . Higher levels of education and a move from jobs in agriculture to construction aided the progress of Latinos in the wage distribution scale . At the same time , there was a large drop in the proportions of workers born in Mexico and Central America who were in the lowest wage class . Among all foreign-born workers , the strongest gains were made by Asians , who significantly boosted their presence in the high-wage workforce .
Almost seven-in-ten Americans ( 68 % ) feel worn out by the amount of news there is these days . While members of both parties say this , Republicans are feeling it more : Roughly three-quarters ( 77 % ) of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents feel worn out over how much news there is , compared with 61 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners .
Socioeconomic status also affects the congregational characteristics that church shoppers value most . Location is particularly important to more affluent , well-educated adults . Roughly three-quarters of church shoppers who either are college educated or who have household incomes of $ 75,000 or more ( 77 % and 75 % , respectively ) say location played an important role in their choice of a new congregation . By comparison , about two-thirds of church shoppers either with a high school degree or less or a household income of less than $ 30,000 ( 64 % and 67 % , respectively ) say location is important .
In 2014 , before spinning off its publishing properties , Gannett had an operating profit margin of 39 % . Following the 2015 spinoff , Gannett 's broadcasting arm , Tegna , had a similar operating profit margin of 37 % – nearly three times that of its publishing sibling ( 13 % ) , which retained the `` Gannett Company '' name . ( Operating profit , often referred to as `` operating income before depreciation and amortization , '' represents the portion of every dollar in sales that accrues as profits , before paying taxes and investors , and excluding figures that fall outside the company 's typical operations . )
Fox News was very tough on the last Democratic candidate for president . ( But MSNBC was even tougher on the Republican . ) During the late stages of the 2012 presidential campaign , a Pew Research analysis found that Barack Obama received far more negative coverage than positive on the Fox News Channel . Yet Fox found its ideological mirror image in MSNBC . In the final stretch of the campaign , nearly half ( 46 % ) of Obama 's coverage on Fox was negative , while just 6 % was positive in tone . But MSNBC produced an even harsher narrative about the Republican in the race : 71 % of Romney 's coverage was negative , versus 3 % positive .
Overall , a majority of Americans ( 58 % ) say that police around the country are doing an excellent or good job of protecting people from crimes – a view held by 78 % of Republicans and Republican leaners but 43 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners . Two-thirds of white adults ( 67 % ) say the police are doing a good or excellent job of protecting people , while just 28 % of Black adults say the same . Half of Hispanic adults say police do an excellent or good job of protecting people .
To understand these differences , this study combines people 's voting histories ( from a national voter file , recently updated to include vote history from the 2016 election ) with their attitudes about politics and civic engagement , based on a nationally representative survey conducted in the spring of last year . In the survey , conducted in March and April during the presidential primaries , just 27 % of drop-off voters said they were following the 2016 election very closely , compared with 49 % of consistent voters . And drop-off voters were less likely than consistent voters to say that it made a lot of difference to them which party controlled the government ; just 39 % of drop-off voters said it mattered a lot whether Democrats or Republicans controlled the government , compared with 52 % of consistent voters .
2 Americans and Germans differ when people in each country are asked which nations are their first and second most important partners . Combining both first and second mentions , Americans name Great Britain more than any other country ( 33 % ) , followed by China ( 24 % ) , Germany ( 12 % ) , Israel ( 12 % ) and Canada ( 10 % ) . In Germany , France gathers the most votes as either first or second most important partner ( 63 % ) , followed by the U.S. ( 43 % ) . Lagging far behind in the eyes of Germans are Russia ( 11 % ) , China ( 7 % ) and Great Britain ( 6 % ) .
People attribute new cases of the coronavirus to a mix of factors . Majorities say that COVID-19 's spreading more easily than other infectious diseases ( 68 % ) , not enough testing available for coronavirus ( 58 % ) and not enough people following social distancing measures ( 57 % ) are major reasons the U.S. is seeing new cases of the coronavirus .
Parents generally get positive ratings from teens about their efforts to tackle online harassment and bullying . Roughly six-in-ten teens ( 59 % ) say parents are doing an excellent or good job at addressing cyberbullying – a notably positive assessment , considering how teens rate other groups measured in this survey . Teens are far less likely to rate the anti-bullying efforts of elected officials , social media companies and teachers positively .
However , this skeptical outlook on government does not mean people have given up on democracy or the ability of average citizens to have an impact on how the country is run . Roughly half or more in eight nations – Kenya , Nigeria , South Africa , the U.S. , India , Greece , Italy and Poland – say ordinary citizens can have a lot of influence on government . Hungary , where 61 % say there is little citizens can do , is the lone nation where pessimism clearly outweighs optimism on this front .
Nearly eight-in-ten ( 79 % ) newsroom employees in the newspaper , broadcasting and internet publishing industries – including reporters , editors , photographers and videographers – have at least a college degree , according to the analysis of 2012 - 2016 American Community Survey data . Among employees in all other occupations and industries , only about a third ( 36 % ) have graduated from college . Very few newsroom employees have a high school education or less ( 4 % ) , compared with a third of all other workers .
While the national news media focused heavily on the 2008 presidential campaign last week , the public divided its interest between the campaign and the Iraq war . More than one-fifth of the national newshole ( 21 % ) was devoted to the presidential campaign , while news about the war — including the situation in Iraq , returning U.S. troops and the Iraq policy debate — drew only about half as much coverage .
More than three-quarters ( 77 % ) of newsroom employees – those who work as reporters , editors , photographers and videographers in the newspaper , broadcasting and internet publishing industries – are non-Hispanic whites , according to the analysis of 2012 - 2016 American Community Survey data . That is true of 65 % of U.S. workers in all occupations and industries combined . Newsroom employees are also more likely than workers overall to be male . About six-in-ten newsroom employees ( 61 % ) are men , compared with 53 % of all workers . When combining race/ethnicity and gender , almost half ( 48 % ) of newsroom employees are non-Hispanic white men compared with about a third ( 34 % ) of workers overall .
News about the spread of the H1N1 virus – and uncertainty about its potential danger – grabbed people 's attention in a busy news week that also included the bankruptcy filing by Chrysler , the 100th day of the Obama presidency and a party switch by veteran senator Arlen Specter . Still , close to four-in-ten ( 39 % ) say they followed news about the virus more closely than any other story . Reporting about the swine flu also dominated news coverage . According to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism , reporting on the virus accounted for 31 % of the newshole examined . No other story came close .
Majorities in the other Western European countries included in the 2009 poll also expressed support for tougher restrictions on immigration . About eight-in-ten in Spain ( 80 % ) and Britain ( 78 % ) shared that view , as did 65 % in Germany and 64 % in France .
The survey – which , again , was largely completed before Barr 's report on the Mueller investigation – finds that 64 % of Americans say that Trump definitely ( 33 % ) or probably ( 31 % ) has done something illegal while in office or when he was running for president . Only half as many ( 32 % ) say he definitely or probably has not done things that are illegal . An even larger share ( 72 % ) thinks Trump definitely or probably has done something unethical – with 46 % saying he has definitely done this .
Another marker of class differences – household income – is also a strong indicator of internet usage . Adults living in households with an annual income of at least $ 75,000 a year are the most likely to use the internet , with 97 % of adults in this group currently reporting they are internet users . Those living in households with an annual income under $ 30,000 a year are less likely to report internet usage , with 74 % of adults doing so now . These trends have been consistent over time , although the more recent rise of smartphones has provided internet access to lower-income people , sometimes with lower prices , sometimes with other attractive technology features . Indeed , a recent report released by Pew Research found that lower-income Americans are increasingly `` smartphone-dependent '' for internet access .
About six-in-ten Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters ( 61 % ) say they think of their vote as a vote against Trump ; in June 2006 , a comparable share of Democrats ( 65 % ) considered their midterm vote to be a vote against George W. Bush . In both 2010 and 2014 , smaller shares of Republican voters thought of their vote as a vote against Obama ( 54 % in 2010 , 51 % in 2014 ) .
Among the nation 's immigrants , Spanish is by far the most spoken non-English language ( 42 % of immigrants say they speak Spanish at home ) , but it is not the only non-English language spoken by immigrants . Some 6 % of immigrants speak Chinese ( including Mandarin and Cantonese ) , 5 % speak Hindi or a related language , 4 % speak Filipino or Tagalog , 3 % speak Vietnamese , 3 % speak French and 2 % speak Dravidian .
Teens are divided on whether they spend too much or too little time playing video games . A quarter of teens ( 26 % ) believe they spend too much time playing video games , while a similar share ( 22 % ) feels they spend too little time doing so . And as with video game playing in general , these findings differ by gender . Four-in-ten boys ages 13 to 17 ( 41 % ) say they spend too much time playing video games , nearly four times the share of girls who say the same ( 11 % ) . And a larger share of boys ( 65 % ) than girls ( 50 % ) have cut back on the amount of time they spend playing games . Three-in-ten girls believe they spend too little time playing games , a view shared by just 14 % of boys .
Overall , about half of Americans ( 49 % ) say human activity contributes a great deal to climate change , and another 30 % say human actions have some role in climate change . Two-in-ten ( 20 % ) believe human activity plays not too much or no role at all in climate change .
Asked how they would feel if they saw a drone flying close to where they live , relatively large shares of Americans say they would be curious ( 58 % ) or interested ( 45 % ) . At the same time , around one-in-four ( 26 % ) say they would be nervous , and around one-in-ten say this would make them feel angry ( 12 % ) or scared ( 11 % ) .
For instance , 78 % of Republicans and Republican leaners living in districts that Republican candidates for Congress won by wide margins in 2016 said the quality of those who ran for Congress in the last several elections was very or somewhat good , compared with 53 % of Democrats in these districts . Similarly , while 71 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners in safe Democratic districts said candidate quality in their district had generally been good , that compares with just 50 % of Republicans and Republican leaners in these districts .
Despite all the pope 's activities over the years , the U.S. media primarily focused on two main stories , with little attention to religious issues the Pope dealt with during his tenure .
Middle Eastern views of China are mixed . In both Egypt and Lebanon , positive views outweigh negative ones , but in Jordan negative ratings are slightly more common . Similarly , opinions are mixed in Latin America , and many in the region are unable to offer either a positive or negative assessment . Majorities in only nine of the 23 countries surveyed express a favorable view of the Chinese people . Some of the highest ratings come from neighboring countries , including Pakistan ( 78 % favorable ) , Australia ( 73 % ) and Indonesia ( 59 % ) . Elsewhere in Asia , views are mixed , in South Korea and India , and decidedly negative in Japan , where 73 % have an unfavorable opinion , by far the most negative assessment of the Chinese people in the survey .
Whites also are nearly three times as likely as blacks to express at least a fair amount of confidence in the investigations into the shooting . About half of whites ( 52 % ) say they have a great deal or fair amount of confidence in the investigations , compared with just 18 % of blacks . Roughly three-quarters of blacks ( 76 % ) have little or no confidence in the investigations , with 45 % saying they have no confidence at all .
Ukraine is an overwhelmingly Orthodox Christian nation , with nearly eight-in-ten adults ( 78 % ) identifying as Orthodox ( compared with 71 % in Russia ) , according to a 2015 Pew Research Center survey of much of the country ( some contested areas in eastern Ukraine were not surveyed ) . This is up from 39 % who said they were Orthodox Christian in 1991 – the year the officially atheist Soviet Union collapsed and Ukraine gained its independence . With roughly 35 million Orthodox Christians , Ukraine now has the third-largest Orthodox population in the world , after Russia and Ethiopia .
Most countries and territories allow voters abroad to cast ballots in some capacity . That 's the case in the U.S. and another 151 of the 216 countries and territories evaluated by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance , at least for national legislative , European Parliament or presidential elections . Among those , many allow external voting for legislative elections ( 124 ) , presidential elections ( 88 ) or referenda ( 74 ) , and just 24 allow it for sub-national elections . Around the world , 55 countries and territories do not allow any voting from abroad . Many of these countries are located in Latin America , sub-Saharan Africa and the Asia-Pacific region .
In a two-way question , 58 % of Republicans said the main purpose of college should be to teach specific skills and knowledge for the workplace ; 28 % said it should be personal growth . Democrats were divided : 43 % said the main purpose of college should be to learn specific skills while 42 % said personal growth .
So far , Obama has made recess appointments 32 times , according to a Feb. 2013 analysis by the Congressional Research Service . Among the last four presidents , Ronald Reagan made the most recess appointments ( 232 ) , followed by George W. Bush ( 171 ) , Bill Clinton ( 139 ) and George H.W . Bush ( 78 ) , who served only one term . These include not only ones made between sessions of Congress , but ones during recesses within a session .
66 College majors matter . Among all grads , science or engineering majors are the most likely to say their current job is very closely related to their field of study and the least likely to say that a different major would have better prepared them for the job they really wanted .
The Center defined political tweeters – 31 % of all U.S. adult users with public accounts – as those who had tweeted at least five times , and at least twice about national politics , over the study period . But within this broader group , there is a subset of highly prolific political tweeters who created 10 or more tweets between June 10 , 2018 , and June 9 , 2019 , with at least 25 % of them mentioning national politics .
While Western Europeans prefer to get news from TV , it 's important to note that they tend to rely on more than one platform . Majorities in all eight Western European countries surveyed get news daily from two or more platform types . And in some countries , including Sweden and Germany , around half of adults get news daily from three or four different platforms .
A narrow majority of Americans ( 54 % ) support the death penalty for people convicted of murder , according to a spring 2018 survey . But only around a third of blacks ( 36 % ) support capital punishment for this crime , compared with nearly six-in-ten whites ( 59 % ) .
Students receive the highest marks from these teachers for their ability to use appropriate and effective search queries and their understanding of how online search results are generated . Yet even for these skills , only about one-quarter of teachers surveyed here rate their students `` excellent '' or `` very good . '' Indeed , in our focus groups , many teachers suggest that despite being raised in the `` digital age , '' today 's students are surprisingly lacking in their online search skills . Students receive the lowest marks for `` patience and determination in looking for information that is hard to find , '' with 43 % of teachers rating their students `` poor '' in this regard , and another 35 % rating their students `` fair . ''
For example , on abortion and gay marriage , about as many Republicans want the party to support a more conservative stance rather than move in a more moderate direction . On immigration , most Republicans tilt toward taking a more conservative approach . Among five issues tested , on only one – gun policy – do a majority of Republican voters say the party 's position is about right . But other polls show the Republicans remain pretty far away from the general electorate on gun policy .
While the public continues to say a new economic stimulus package is needed to address the impact of the coronavirus , Republicans have turned more skeptical about the need for additional economic stimulus . About seven-in-ten Americans ( 71 % ) say a new package is needed , beyond the $ 2 trillion package passed by President Donald Trump and Congress in March . That is down from 77 % who said this in April .
An estimated 464,000 Hispanics of Nicaraguan origin resided in the United States in 2017 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey . Nicaraguans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Nicaraguan origin ; this includes immigrants from Nicaragua and those who trace their family ancestry to Nicaragua . Nicaraguans are the 12th-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States , accounting for less than 1 % of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017 . Since 2000 , the Nicaraguan-origin population has increased 128 % , growing from 203,000 to 464,000 over the period . At the same time , the Nicaraguan foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 63 % , up from 156,000 in 2000 to 255,000 in 2017 . By comparison , Mexicans , the nation 's largest Hispanic origin group , constituted 36.6 million , or 62 % , of the Hispanic population in 2017 .
About two-thirds of Hispanic registered voters ( 68 % ) disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president , including 51 % who disapprove very strongly . The 30 % of Hispanic voters who approve of Trump includes 23 % who approve strongly . As with the U.S. public overall , views of Trump 's job performance among Latino registered voters are tied to partisanship – 93 % of Democrats disapprove of Trump 's job performance , with 73 % disapproving very strongly . Meanwhile , among Republicans , 75 % approve of Trump 's job performance , with 58 % approving very strongly .
The new survey shows , however , that public confidence in the United Nations is a major victim of the conflict in Iraq . Positive ratings for the world body have tumbled in nearly every country for which benchmark measures are available . Majorities or pluralities in most countries believe that the war in Iraq showed the U.N. to be not so important any more . The idea that the U.N. is less relevant is much more prevalent now than it was just before the war , and is shared by people in countries that backed the war , the U.S. and Great Britain , as well as in nations that opposed it , notably France and Germany .
Residents in the three types of communities also differ on how important they think the internet is for getting local news . Urban residents are more digitally focused in their local news habits , placing greater emphasis on the internet for local news . About four-in-ten urban residents ( 37 % ) say the internet is their most important source of local news , compared with 32 % in suburban areas and 26 % of those in rural areas . They are also more likely than rural residents to often get news from websites and apps ( 29 % for urban vs. 23 % for rural , along with 27 % of suburban residents ) .
This survey finds that this is indeed the case . Examining the group of individuals asked about their comfort or likely engagement with all three steps , we find that fully seven-in-ten of those who are very confident that public health organizations will protect their personal records from hackers or unauthorized users also say that they would be comfortable or likely to engage with all three steps of the process . That compares with smaller shares of those who express less confidence ( 56 % of those who are somewhat confident , 36 % of those who are not too confident and 21 % of those who are not at all confident ) .
In New England , 62 % favor same-sex marriage , while 29 % oppose it . In the mid-Atlantic , 57 % favor and 34 % oppose allowing gay marriage . Opinions among those on the Pacific Coast are similar ( 54 % favor , 37 % oppose ) .
Overall , 54 % say that from what they 've read and heard , the amount of energy produced in the U.S. has been increasing in recent years ; just 10 % say it has been decreasing , while 27 % say it 's been staying about the same . Last fall , somewhat fewer ( 48 % ) said they thought energy production in the U.S. was up . College graduates are among the most likely to say the amount of energy produced in the U.S. has been increasing ( 67 % ) ; those with no college experience are less likely to hold this view ( 44 % ) .
Among Democrats , however , news interest plays a large role in whether they feel misunderstood . About a quarter of Democrats who are very interested in the news feel misunderstood ( 27 % ) , compared with about four-in-ten of the somewhat interested ( 39 % ) and roughly half of those not interested ( 52 % ) . Still , Democrats at all levels of news interest are much less likely than Republicans to feel misunderstood by the news media . ( For more on the measure of news interest , see this report . )
Currently , 21 % of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they can trust government , compared with 14 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners . Throughout Obama 's tenure , more Democrats than Republicans reported trusting the government , though that has flipped since Trump 's election . Since the 1970s , trust in government has been consistently higher among members of the party that controls the White House than among the opposition party . However , Republicans have been much more reactive than Democrats to changes in political power . Republicans have expressed much higher levels of trust during Republican than during Democratic presidencies , while Democrats ' attitudes have tended to be more consistent , regardless of which party controls the White House .
Across the countries surveyed , fewer than half say they approve of the way the EU is handling European economic issues ( median of 40 % ) , Brexit ( median of 38 % ) and the refugee issue ( median of 23 % ) . Ratings of the EU 's performance , however , vary widely from country to country .
Higher shares of adults in Senegal and South Africa say they have friends or relatives they stay in touch with regularly in Europe than say this about friends or relatives in the U.S . Meanwhile , in Ghana , Nigeria and Tanzania , people have friends or relatives they stay in touch with in Europe and the U.S. at about the same rate . In Kenya , a higher share of people have contacts in the United States .
Men and women express similar views on abortion ; 60 % of women say it should be legal in all or most cases , as do 61 % of men .
Overall , 48 % of U.S. adults say medical treatments are `` worth the costs because they allow people to live longer and better quality lives , '' while a similar share ( 51 % ) says such treatments `` often create as many problems as they solve . '' As Americans assess potential problems with health care , most demographic and political groups are closely divided over whether medical treatments are worth the costs because they allow people to live longer and better quality lives , or whether medical treatments often create as many problems as they solve .
In 2014 , just 28 % of Millennials were married . This makes them remarkably different than members of the Silent Generation at the same stage in their lives : fully 64 % of Silents were married when members of their generation were between the ages of 18 and 33 . About half ( 49 % ) of Baby Boomers and 38 % of Gen Xers were married when their generation was ages 18 to 33 . Generational analysis allows for these comparative snapshots , but it also lets researchers track what happens as these cohorts age .
Across 27 nations surveyed by Pew Research Center in 2018 , people were more dissatisfied than satisfied with the way democracy is working in their country . This held especially true in a dozen countries where negative views of democracy outpaced positive by more than 10 percentage points . The 12 countries most dissatisfied with their democracy included four – Mexico , Greece , Brazil and Spain – where eight-in-ten or more were dissatisfied with the state of democracy , and another five where six-in-ten or more expressed dissatisfaction : Tunisia , Italy , South Africa , Argentina and Nigeria . The United States was close behind , with 58 % expressing unhappiness with the way democracy is functioning .
While the general sentiment among police that the media treat them unfairly is shared across gender , racial and ethnic lines , some officers feel more strongly about it than others . White officers ( 43 % ) , for example , are more likely than their black colleagues ( 34 % ) to strongly agree that the media treat police unfairly . Among Hispanic officers , 40 % strongly agree . Age is also correlated with views about the media . While 46 % of officers ages 18 to 44 strongly agree that the media treat the police unfairly , fewer of those ages 45 and older ( 36 % ) express the same view . Police department administrators have a different view on the media than rank-and-file officers and sergeants . Only 29 % of administrators strongly agree that the media treat police unfairly , compared with roughly four-in-ten rank-and-file officers and sergeants .
The share of Republicans who give Democrats a `` cold '' rating on a 0 - 100 thermometer has risen 14 percentage points since 2016 – with virtually all of the increase coming in `` very cold '' ratings ( 0 - 24 ) . Democrats ' views of Republicans have followed a similar trajectory : 57 % give Republicans a very cold rating , up from 41 % three years ago .
The controversial comments about rape and abortion made by Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin drew limited public attention . One-in-four ( 25 % ) followed this story very closely , but another one-in-three ( 33 % ) say they did not follow this closely at all . Interest in the Akin controversy was most widespread among Democrats , 34 % of whom followed this very closely , compared with 25 % of Republicans and just 19 % of independents . There was no significant gender gap in the amount of attention given to Rep. Akin 's comments . A quarter of women and men ( 25 % each followed the story very closely .
Nine-in-ten Lebanese Sunnis rated themselves favorably . At least seven-in-ten said the same among Lebanese Shiites ( 77 % ) and Christians ( 71 % ) – still mostly positive but lower than the rating Sunnis gave to themselves .
The April 20 - 26 survey asked Americans whether states are still holding Democratic Party primaries . The response was a virtual tie between the 43 % who answered correctly that primaries are still being held and the 41 % who say they are not sure of the answer . A small minority of respondents ( 14 % ) answered that the states had ended the primary season .
Public interest in news about the Iraq war has remained steady over the past two months . Last week , 27 % of Americans followed news about the war very closely and 10 % said it was the story they followed more closely than any other .
When asked whether their countries have made progress over the past three decades across a range of issues , the Central and Eastern European publics surveyed feel most positive about issues like education and living standards . But opinions are more divided about progress on law and order and family values , and most say the changes have had a negative impact on health care .
The Center 's survey found other indications that gun owners are more politically engaged than non-gun owners . For example , while only 16 % of U.S. adults say they 've ever given money to an organization that takes a position on gun policy , gun owners are again more likely than non-gun owners to say they have done so . Among gun owners , 28 % say they have ever given money to an organization like this , including 12 % of who have done so in the past year . The same is true for just 10 % of non-owners , including 6 % who have done so in the past year .
About two-thirds of U.S. adults ( 68 % ) say the federal government has a responsibility to provide medical care to undocumented immigrants who are ill with the coronavirus , even as relatively few ( 37 % ) say the government should offer economic help to undocumented immigrants who have lost their job due to the outbreak , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted April 29 to May 5 . Views on these questions vary widely by race and ethnicity , partisan identification and other characteristics . Hispanics are the most supportive of the federal government providing medical and economic support to undocumented immigrants affected by the coronavirus outbreak . The vast majority of Hispanics ( 86 % ) say the government has a responsibility to provide medical care , and around six-in-ten ( 62 % ) say the same about economic help . Hispanic immigrants are more likely than U.S.-born Hispanics ( 68 % vs. 55 % ) to support federal economic help for undocumented immigrants affected by the outbreak , but views between the two groups are more similar when it comes to medical care ( 88 % vs. 83 % ) . A strong majority of black adults ( 80 % ) also say the federal government has a responsibility to provide medical care , while about half ( 55 % ) say the government should provide economic help to undocumented immigrants affected by the coronavirus . By contrast , far lower shares of white adults say the government should provide medical care ( 61 % ) and economic help ( 27 % ) .
Overall , roughly one-third of Americans who identify as Republican or as Republican-leaning independents do not agree with their party on abortion ( 35 % ) , including 12 % who say they agree with the Democratic Party on abortion and 23 % who say they do not agree with either party . Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents , three-in-ten do not agree with their party on abortion , including 7 % who say they agree with the GOP and 22 % who say they do n't agree with either party . ( The same 2019 survey found that roughly a fifth to a third of Americans do n't agree with their party on issues including policies to deal with the economy , health care and illegal immigration . )
Americans are closely divided in their view of the news media 's coverage of climate change . Some 47 % of U.S. adults say the media does a good job covering global climate change , while 51 % say they do a bad job . A 58 % majority of people following climate news very closely say the media do a good job , however . Conservative Republicans stand out as more negative in their overall views about climate change news coverage . Public ratings of the media may be linked to views about the mix of news coverage . In all , 35 % of Americans say the media exaggerates the threat from climate change , a roughly similar share ( 42 % ) says the media does not take the threat seriously enough ; two-in-ten ( 20 % ) say the media are about right in their reporting . People 's views on this are strongly linked with political divides ; 72 % of conservative Republicans say the media exaggerates the threat of climate change , while 64 % of liberal Democrats say the media does not take the threat of climate change seriously enough .
There are similar differences among typology groups in opinions about more gays and lesbians raising children . While 40 % of Solid Liberals view this trend as good thing for society , just 9 % of Hard-Pressed Democrats and 10 % of New Coalition Democrats agree .
Russians and Ukrainians disagree on what to do about the regions in eastern Ukraine , where the separatist movement has been the strongest . Ukrainians would like the Luhans'k and Donets'k regions to remain part of Ukraine , either with the same terms as before the conflict ( 51 % ) or with more autonomy from Kyiv ( 33 % ) . But Russians prefer that the region either become independent states ( 35 % ) or part of Russia ( 24 % ) , rather than stay with Ukraine ( 32 % ) .
Amid recent speculation that Mitt Romney was considering a possible third run at the executive office , the former Massachusetts governor comes in third with 74 campaign stories . Following Romney is Texas Senator Ted Cruz ( 68 ) , Kentucky Senator Rand Paul ( 67 ) and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush ( 53 ) .
Veterans of the post-9/11 wars are among those who give the VA low marks . A survey conducted Aug. 1 – Dec .15 last year by the Washington Post and Kaiser Family Foundation of soldiers who had served in Iraq or Afghanistan found that 58 % rated the job the VA was doing to meet the needs of veterans as only fair or poor , while just 38 % graded it excellent or good . The veterans agency fared somewhat better in an extensive survey of post-9/11 veterans conducted in 2011 by the Pew Research Center . About half ( 51 % ) said the VA was doing an excellent or good job in meeting the needs of military veterans ( with 12 % rating it excellent ) while 44 % rated it only fair or poor .
Open access to data and independent review of research increase public confidence in research findings . The survey asked respondents about four factors that could affect their trust in research findings . More than half of Americans ( 57 % ) say they trust research findings more if the data from the study is openly available to the public , and 52 % say they trust research findings more if they have been reviewed by an independent committee . In contrast , a majority of Americans ( 58 % ) say industry funding makes them trust scientific findings less . The influence of government funding on public trust is less clear : About a quarter ( 23 % ) say it makes the findings more trustworthy , 28 % say it makes findings less trustworthy and about half ( 48 % ) say it makes no difference .
But while the U.S and EU have large migrant populations from many parts of the world , the origins of U.S. migrants are less diverse . About a quarter ( 26 % ) of all immigrants in the U.S. come from just one country – Mexico . By contrast , Turkey was the top origin country for EU migrants ( excluding internal migrants ) in 2015 – but its 8 % share does not nearly rival Mexico 's in the U.S .
Hispanics are also divided about the impact of illegal immigration on Hispanics already living in the U.S . Roughly equal shares say the impact has been positive ( 29 % ) , negative ( 31 % ) or made no difference ( 30 % ) . This mixed judgment stands in sharp contrast to views that Latinos expressed on this subject in 2007 . Back then , fully half ( 50 % ) of Latinos said the impact was positive , while just 20 % said it was negative .1
Overall , Americans are divided when it comes to their level of concern about surveillance programs . In a survey conducted November 2014-January 2015 , 52 % described themselves as `` very concerned '' or `` somewhat concerned '' about government surveillance of Americans ' data and electronic communications , compared with 46 % who described themselves as `` not very concerned '' or `` not at all concerned '' about the surveillance . Those who followed the news about the Snowden leaks and the ensuing debates were more anxious about privacy policy and their own privacy than those who did not . The public generally believes it is acceptable for the government to monitor many others , including foreign citizens , foreign leaders and American leaders . Yet 57 % said it was unacceptable for the government to monitor the communications of U.S. citizens . At the same time , majorities supported monitoring of those particular individuals who use words like `` explosives '' and `` automatic weapons '' in their search engine queries ( 65 % said that ) and those who visit anti-American websites ( 67 % said that ) .
More than four-in-ten ( 44 % ) expect relations between Republicans and Democrats in Washington will get worse in the coming year . In 2014 , after the GOP won full control of Congress , 34 % said partisan relations would worsen and in 2006 , after Democrats won majorities in the House and Senate , just 20 % expressed this view .
Partisanship and ideology remain some of the strongest factors underlying attitudes about whether Earth is warming , our survey finds . Today , roughly nine-in-ten liberal Democrats ( 92 % ) say that there is solid evidence Earth 's average temperature is rising , and 76 % attribute this rise mostly to human activity . Very few liberal Democrats ( 5 % ) say there is not solid evidence of warming . A clear 83 % majority of conservative and moderate Democrats also say Earth is warming , but just 55 % say this is the result of human activity . By contrast , just 38 % of conservative Republicans say that there is solid evidence of global warming . Reflecting a divide within the GOP , conservative Republicans stand out as the only ideological group in which a majority ( 56 % ) says that there is not solid evidence of a rise in the earth 's temperature ( a 61 % majority of moderate and liberal Republicans say Earth is warming ) .
Americans are more likely to see social media as providing connections with others than causing negative experiences . While prior Center research has found that exposure to social media content may indirectly make some people feel stressed , Americans say they are more likely to find connection online than to have negative experiences . In a 2018 survey of U.S. social media users , a majority ( 71 % ) said they frequently or sometimes see content that makes them feel connected on social media . Fewer said they encountered negative content , though 49 % said they frequently or sometimes see things that make them feel depressed and 31 % said they frequently or sometimes see content that makes them feel lonely .
In the wake of reports that the National Security Agency ( NSA ) has been listening to phone calls of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other heads of state , a 56 % majority of Americans say it is unacceptable for the U.S. to monitor the phones of allied leaders , while 36 % say the practice is acceptable .
The public does not give Obama a strong vote of confidence on health care policy ; while 50 % have a great deal or some confidence in him , nearly as many ( 48 % ) express little or no confidence . However , just 32 % have at least some confidence in GOP leaders while about twice as many ( 66 % ) have little or no confidence in them on health policy .
White and black voters are more likely to say they turned out to vote on Election Day than beforehand ( 56 % of white voters and 59 % of black voters say they voted on Election Day ) . About half of Hispanic voters report voting on Election Day , while half say they voted early ( 49 % vs. 50 % ) .
Russians and Americans are both similarly split on the changing nature of American power – but are more likely to say Russia 's international importance is rising . Opinions in both countries are divided over whether the U.S. is playing a more important , equally important or less important role in the world compared with 10 years ago . But there is more agreement that Russia 's importance has increased . Around seven-in-ten Russians ( 72 % ) say this , as do 52 % of Americans . People in both countries also agree that China plays a more important role in the world today than a decade ago ( 73 % and 72 % , respectively ) .
Seventy years after the end of the Chinese Civil War , about two-thirds of adults in Taiwan identify as just Taiwanese . On the other hand , about three-in-ten ( 28 % ) see themselves as both Taiwanese and Chinese . The question asks respondents whether they consider themselves Taiwanese , Chinese or both . A mere 4 % see themselves as only Chinese . These findings are consistent with other polls showing that people in Taiwan increasingly identify only as Taiwanese as opposed to both Taiwanese and Chinese or solely Chinese .
To varying degrees , the same pattern also holds true across these five countries . The disparity is most pronounced in New Zealand , where the top quartile of most active legislative tweeters produced 76 % of all legislative tweets . The conversation is least concentrated in the U.S. , where the top quarter of legislative tweeters only posted 58 % of total tweets from members of Congress .
There are various reasons why nonvoters decide not to vote . Nearly half ( 49 % ) say not liking politics was either a major reason ( 26 % ) or minor reason ( 23 % ) they did not vote .
Just 3 % of self-reported voters in the 2018 election say it was the first time they had ever voted ; 97 % say they had participated in elections before this year . However , 27 % of midterm voters under age 25 say it was their first time voting . First time voters make up just 5 % of voters ages 25 to 29 and 4 % of those 30 to 39 . Just 1 % of those 40 and older say this . About one-in-ten Hispanic voters ( 12 % ) say this was the first election they had participated in ; by comparison , just 4 % of black voters and 1 % of white voters say this .
As new conflicts emerge , the top origin countries of refugees can change suddenly . But with a growing number of conflicts in the Middle East associated with the Arab Spring , more refugees are fleeing their home countries in the Middle East and North Africa compared with a decade earlier . In 2002 , 16 % of refugees were born in the Middle East and North Africa , while that share rose to 22 % by 2012 . Despite this increase , most refugees are still from countries in the Asia-Pacific and sub-Saharan Africa regions .
Many major economies are predicted to contract in 2020 amid the pandemic , including those of the U.S. , Japan and the euro area . In contrast , the Chinese economy is expected to achieve positive , if modest , growth . Across the 14 countries surveyed , when asked to evaluate the relative economic standing of these areas , a median of 48 % identify China as the world 's leading economic power . The U.S. comes second , with a median of 35 % seeing it as the world 's top economic power .2 Few see Japan or EU countries similarly .
6 '' Angry '' Republicans view Jeb Bush less favorably than several other GOP candidates . Among the nearly one-third of Republicans and leaners who say they are angry with government , about six-in-ten or more say they have favorable views of Ben Carson , Marco Rubio , Donald Trump and Ted Cruz . However , just 36 % of Republicans who express anger toward government view Jeb Bush favorably , while 57 % express an unfavorable opinion of him .
Hispanic self-identification varies across immigrant generations . Among the foreign born from Latin America , nearly all self-identify as Hispanic . But by the fourth generation , only half of people with Hispanic heritage in the U.S. self-identify as Hispanic .
Divisions along party lines also exist in Latinos ' views about the Obama administration . Two-thirds ( 66 % ) of Latino Democrats say his administration 's accomplishments will be better remembered than its failures . By contrast , 59 % of Latino Republicans say the failures will outweigh accomplishments . Overall , half of Latinos ( 48 % ) say the Obama administration 's accomplishments will outweigh its failures , while 36 % say the opposite .
While global views of China are somewhat mixed , attitudes throughout much of the Asia-Pacific – including Taiwan – tend to be more negative . Like in Taiwan , only about a third of Filipino , Indonesian , Australian and South Korean adults hold positive opinions of China .2 Though 23 % of Indians share this view , a sizable percentage do not answer this question .
The public paid less attention to the week 's other major stories . Fewer than one-in-ten cited the issue of immigration ( 8 % ) , the Iraq policy debate ( 7 % ) , the 2008 presidential campaign ( 6 % ) , or the Duke lacrosse case ( 5 % ) as the story they followed most closely last week .
In the current survey , Republicans express confidence in Trump 's decision-making . Overall , 65 % say they think Trump 's approach to making important decisions will be about right ; roughly a quarter ( 28 % ) say he 'll be too impulsive . Conservative Republicans ( 74 % ) are more likely than moderate and liberal Republicans ( 51 % ) to say they think Trump 's decision-making will be about right . By contrast , Democrats overwhelmingly say that Trump will be too impulsive in making important decisions : 84 % say this , compared with just 9 % who think his approach will be about right . A wide majority of liberal Democrats ( 94 % ) say Trump will be too impulsive ; a somewhat smaller majority of conservative and moderate Democrats say the same ( 77 % ) .
Adults younger than 30 are also much more likely to have a favorable view of unions than of corporations ( 75 % vs. 55 % ) . Those in older age groups have similar opinions of unions and corporations . Roughly two-thirds ( 65 % ) of those with family incomes of $ 75,000 or more a year have a positive view of corporations , while smaller shares of those with incomes of $ 30,000- $ 74,999 ( 54 % ) and less than $ 30,000 ( 51 % ) say the same . Households earning less than $ 30,000 a year also are more favorable toward labor unions than business corporations – the only income group for which this is the case .
Last year 's series of Pew Research Center reports on political polarization used a 10-item scale of ideological consistency to place Americans into five categories : consistently conservative or liberal , mostly conservative or liberal , and mixed . By that metric , 9 % of the public overall is consistently conservative , including 20 % of Republicans and Republican leaners ; most of the remaining Republicans and leaners were `` mostly conservative '' ( 33 % ) or had a mixture of liberal and conservative views ( 37 % ) . Consistent conservatives participate in politics at higher rates than most other ideological groups . Political engagement tends to be highest among the most consistent conservatives and liberals , the Pew Research survey found . Half of consistent conservatives , for example , said they had contacted an elected official within the past two years – the highest level of any of our five groups . ( The corresponding figure for all Americans , by the way , was 28 % . ) Consistent conservatives also ranked high on other measurements of political engagement , such as donating money ( 26 % ) , attending campaign events ( 24 % ) and volunteering on a campaign ( 12 % ) .
Many adult Facebook users have altered their use of the platform . A little over half of adult Facebook users in the U.S. ( 54 % ) have adjusted their privacy settings in the past 12 months , according to a separate Center survey conducted in May-June 2018 . The survey followed revelations that former consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had collected data on tens of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge or permission . About four-in-ten adult Facebook users ( 42 % ) have taken a break from checking the platform for several weeks or more , and about a quarter ( 26 % ) have deleted the app from their phone at some point in the past year . Combined , 74 % of adult Facebook users say they have taken at least one of these three actions .
In December 2008 , 71 % of Americans approved of Barack Obama 's cabinet choices , and 58 % expressed positive views of George W. Bush 's high-level appointments in January 2001 , prior to his inauguration . Similarly , higher shares approved of the way that both Obama ( 72 % ) and Bush ( 50 % ) explained their policies and plans for the future than say that about Trump today .
The audience for public television programming declined over the past year : In 2018 , the NewsHour program , which airs on PBS , attracted 1.1 million viewers on average , down 6 % from the year before .
Americans with a postgraduate education are somewhat more likely than those with less education to applaud the international organization 's handling of the outbreak , though the differences are muted . Younger Americans also approve of the WHO 's performance more than older Americans : 52 % of adults under age 30 say it has done excellent or good job , compared with just 39 % of those 65 and older .
At the same time , six-in-ten Americans say in the new survey that scientists should take an active role in public policy debates , while 39 % of Americans say scientists should focus on establishing scientific facts and stay out of science-related policy debates . Opinion on this issue is unchanged from last year .
Republicans who turn to Trump for coronavirus news are also more likely than other Republicans to say the pandemic has been overblown , that Trump is getting the facts about the outbreak right and that public health organizations are not getting the facts right , according to the survey , conducted Aug. 31-Sept. 7 as part of the Center 's American News Pathways project . The poll was fielded before Trump tested positive for the virus and was hospitalized . Respondents to the survey had earlier identified which of 10 types of sources they rely on most for COVID-19 news : Trump and his task force ; international news outlets ; national news outlets ; local news outlets ; state and local elected officials ; public health organizations ; Joe Biden and his campaign ; friends and family ; online forums ; or community newsletters or Listservs . Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents , large differences emerge between those who rely mainly on Trump and those who rely mostly on other sources . But among Democrats and Democratic leaners , no one group of news consumers stands out in the same way .
At a country level , some of the most positive assessments of progress over the past 50 years are found in Vietnam ( 88 % say life is better today ) , India ( 69 % ) and South Korea ( 68 % ) – all societies that have seen dramatic economic transformations since the late 1960s , not to mention the end of armed conflict in the case of Vietnam . A majority in Turkey ( 65 % better ) also share a sense of progress over the past five decades . In some of the more developed countries , publics also report that life is better today , including 65 % in Japan and Germany , and 64 % in the Netherlands and Sweden .
An April 2014 poll found that extensive Washington experience was viewed more negatively than positively , more so among Republicans than Democrats . Republicans ( 36 % ) more than Democrats ( 20 % ) said they would be less likely to vote for a candidate with Washington experience . That figure rose to 56 % for Republicans and Republican leaners who agreed with the Tea Party . Almost half of Republicans and Democrats said it would n't matter to them if a candidate had been an elected official in Washington .
A median of 57 % say immigration increases the risk of terrorism in their countries , while 38 % say it has no impact . Still , in France , Spain and the UK , half or more believe immigration does not increase the odds of terrorism .
Women are more likely than men to report increased importance and greater time spent on the site . Some 16 % of female users ( and 7 % of men ) say that Facebook has become more important to them over the last year , and 16 % of female users ( and 9 % of men ) say that they spend more time on the site now than they did a year ago .
The partisan differences on these questions are wide . Three-quarters of Democrats ( 76 % ) say they plan to tune in to Obama 's address , compared with 49 % of Republicans and 52 % of independents . On the other hand , 63 % of Republicans say they plan to watch the debate , compared with 30 % of Democrats and 39 % of independents .
Most Americans support a way for unauthorized immigrants to gain legal status if they meet certain requirements . Seven-in-ten Americans support a way for undocumented immigrants to gain legal status if certain requirements are met . Most of those who support legal status think there should be a way for unauthorized immigrants to become citizens ( 43 % overall ) , while 24 % say the path should only include permanent residency . About eight-in-ten ( 83 % ) Democrats favor a pathway to legal status compared with 53 % of Republicans . Majorities of blacks ( 75 % ) and whites ( 64 % ) continue to say undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the U.S. legally if certain requirements are met . And about nine-in-ten ( 92 % ) Hispanics continue to support a pathway to legal status .
At the same time , there is increased support for additional economic and diplomatic sanctions against Russia . Six-in-ten ( 60 % ) favor the U.S. increasing sanctions on Russia , while 34 % are opposed . Support for tougher sanctions against Russia has risen seven points from last April .
Public awareness of specific components of the law varies widely . About seven-in-ten ( 69 % ) say that the law requires uninsured people to get health insurance .
Here , too , there are differences in views by party and age . Fully 68 % of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents think there has been too much media coverage of demonstrations , while 18 % think the amount of coverage has been about right and 11 % say there has been too little coverage . By contrast , 43 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners think there has been the right amount of coverage , 29 % think there has been too little and 26 % say there has been too much media coverage of demonstrations these days .
Among the public , three-in-ten ( 32 % ) followed Obama 's appointments and plans very closely , making it among the most closely followed stories of the week . One-in-four ( 24 % ) say that the transition was the story they followed most closely . Reports about President Bush 's last days in the White House were followed very closely by 12 % of the public ; this was the top story for 1 % of Americans . These stories accounted for 1 % of total news .
About one-in-five Americans ( 22 % ) have contributed to a `` crowdfunded '' online fundraising project , while 3 % have created their own fundraising project on one of these sites . Although large-scale fundraising projects get most of the attention in news stories , there are far more instances of people using crowdfunding platforms to help someone in need , often a person close to them . Roughly two-thirds ( 68 % ) of crowdfunding donors have contributed to a project to help a person facing a hardship or financial challenge , and around six-in-ten say they did so on behalf of an acquaintance , close friend or family member .
President Obama 's job approval has ticked up in recent months , to 48 % currently , and his rating dwarfs the 26 % approval measure for the leaders of the new Republican Congress . Yet the public is divided over whether Obama or Republican congressional leaders should take the lead in solving the nation 's problems : 40 % say Obama while 38 % say GOP leaders . That is virtually unchanged from a few days after the midterm elections in November . The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center , conducted Feb. 18 - 22 , 2015 among 1,504 adults , finds that both parties are viewed by majorities as having strong principles . Somewhat more say this about the GOP ( 63 % ) than the Democratic Party ( 57 % ) .
Views on whether whites benefit from societal advantages that blacks do not have are split sharply along racial and partisan lines . Nearly eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents ( 78 % ) say white people benefit at least a fair amount from advantages that blacks do not have . Among Republicans and Republican leaners , 72 % say whites do not benefit much or at all from these advantages . An overwhelming majority of blacks ( 92 % ) say whites benefit from societal advantages , while just 46 % of whites say the same .
Strong growth in Hispanic enrollment is expected to continue for decades , according to a recently released U.S. Census Bureau population projection . The bureau projects that the Hispanic school-age population will increase by 166 % by 2050 ( to 28 million from 11 million in 2006 ) , while the non-Hispanic school-age population will grow by just 4 % ( to 45 million from 43 million ) over this same period .1 In 2050 , there will be more school-age Hispanic children than school-age non-Hispanic white children .
Large majorities say Beijing poses serious challenges for India . Seven-in-ten of those surveyed believe that China 's economic impact on India is a serious problem , including 45 % who voice the view that it is very serious . Nearly half ( 48 % ) of Indians think China 's relationship with Pakistan poses a very serious problem for India . Another 21 % see this as a somewhat serious challenge . Fully 69 % hold the view that China 's growing military power is a problem for India , including 46 % who say this is a very serious issue . And the same proportion ( 69 % ) expresses the opinion that China 's territorial disputes with India are very or somewhat serious . Notably , with regard to problems posed by China , BJP adherents are more intensely worried than Congress backers .
Four-in-ten Republicans give Michelle Obama a zero . Republicans feel very negatively toward Barack Obama , but a majority also gives `` very cold '' thermometer ratings to Michelle Obama . Fully 81 % of Republicans feel very coldly toward Barack Obama , including 59 % who give him a zero on the 0 - 100 scale . Nearly six-in-ten Republicans ( 59 % ) give very cold ratings to Michelle Obama ; 40 % of Republicans give her a zero .
Notable shares of the public give people in these powerful jobs low ratings when it comes to behaving ethically , dealing with ethical problems in their ranks and admitting mistakes . Half or more of Americans think these influential people act unethically at least some of the time , ranging from 50 % who believe this about military leaders to 81 % who feel members of Congress act unethically `` some , '' or `` all or most of the time . '' Additionally , 77 % believe this about the leaders of technology companies and 69 % think this about religious leaders .
For many Americans , going online is an important way to connect with friends and family , shop , get news and search for information . Yet today , 10 % of U.S. adults do not use the internet , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of survey data . For instance , seniors are much more likely than younger adults to say they never go online . Although the share of non-internet users ages 65 and older has decreased by 7 percentage points since 2018 , 27 % still do not use the internet , compared with fewer than 10 % of adults under the age of 65 . Household income and education are also indicators of a person 's likelihood to be offline . Roughly three-in-ten adults with less than a high school education ( 29 % ) do not use the internet in 2019 , compared with 35 % in 2018 . But that share falls as the level of educational attainment increases . Adults from households earning less than $ 30,000 a year are far more likely than the most affluent adults to not use the internet ( 18 % vs. 2 % ) .
Yet the share who says they are very confident in Donald Trump ( 22 % ) is substantially higher than the shares saying this for either Republican leaders ( 9 % ) or Democratic leaders ( 11 % ) in Congress . But the public is also more likely to say they are `` not at all confident '' in Trump 's decision making on tax policy ( 42 % ) than to say this about either party 's leaders in Congress ( 31 % say this about GOP leaders , 24 % about Democratic leaders ) .
Looking ahead , a majority of smart speaker owners also are not seeking more personalization . Different groups of respondents were asked about their desires for the performance of their speakers in the future . In one group , 58 % of smart speaker owners say they would not like their speaker to do a better job of taking their interests and preferences into account in the future , compared with 42 % who would like their speakers to do a better job taking their interests and preferences into account . The second group was asked a more detailed question : whether they would like their speakers to do a better job of taking their interests and preferences into account in the future , even if that meant it would need to collect more personal information about them . Only 33 % say they would appreciate their interests and preferences being taken more into account , even if it meant more personal data collection , while two-thirds ( 66 % ) said they would not like that .
Another troubling aspect of the market downturn identified in the survey was its disproportionate impact on ethnic and racial minorities . When the survey excluded those students who opted to return to school rather than enter the job market , fewer than half of the 2009 minority graduates with undergrad degrees ( 48.6 % ) found full-time jobs compared with 63.9 % of non-minority graduates . That gap of 15.3 % almost tripled from the previous year , when it stood at 5.9 % and represents the biggest such difference in the more than two decades that the University of Georgia has been monitoring this .
Younger users are especially active at utilizing these platforms for employment-related purposes , but many older users are taking advantage of social media when looking for work as well . Roughly one-quarter of social media users ages 50 and older have used these platforms to look for work or to let their friends know about job openings , and 11 % of older social media users have applied for a job they first found out about on social media .
While California prisons are overcrowded , U.S. prisons overall are operating at 99 % capacity , according to the International Centre for Prison Studies , putting the U.S. in the middle of a group of selected countries highlighted by the Economist in the chart above . Topping the list was Haiti , whose population of 9,904 inmates were housed in a system of 17 prisons operating at 336 % occupancy level in 2009 . The U.S. announced plans earlier this year to build two prisons in Haiti 's provinces as part of an international effort to ease the severe overcrowding that often requires inmates to take turns sleeping at night because of lack of space .
Depression has become increasingly common among American teenagers – especially teen girls , who are now almost three times as likely as teen boys to have had recent experiences with depression . In 2017 , 13 % of U.S. teens ages 12 to 17 ( or 3.2 million ) said they had experienced at least one major depressive episode in the past year , up from 8 % ( or 2 million ) in 2007 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health . One-in-five teenage girls – or nearly 2.4 million – had experienced at least one major depressive episode ( the proxy measure of depression used in this analysis ) over the past year in 2017 . By comparison , 7 % of teenage boys ( or 845,000 ) had at least one major depressive episode in the past 12 months .
In 2018 , nearly half ( 47 % ) of the world 's resettled refugees were from Middle Eastern countries , while almost one-third ( 32 % ) were from Africa . People from Middle Eastern countries – mostly Syria and Iraq – accounted for 49 % of resettled refugees in Australia , 55 % in Canada and 85 % in the UK . By contrast , fewer than 1 % of refugees resettled in the U.S. in 2018 were from the Middle East , in part due to shifting regional caps . Most resettled refugees in the U.S. were from countries in Africa ( 51 % ) or Asia ( 27 % ) .
Opinions of Russia are more unfavorable than favorable in 26 nations . The strongest negative sentiment is in Poland and Jordan ( both 80 % ) . The former is a legacy of a long history of bilateral tensions . Public opinion in Jordan may be influenced by Moscow 's current support for the regime of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria , Jordan 's neighbor and the source of hundreds of thousands of refugees in Jordan . Anti-Russian sentiment is also particularly strong in Israel ( 74 % ) , Japan ( 73 % ) , Germany ( 70 % ) and France ( 70 % ) .
Republicans hold a 49 % -40 % lead over the Democrats in leaned party identification among whites . The Democrats hold an 80 % -11 % advantage among blacks , and lead by more than two-to-one among Hispanics ( 56 % -26 % ) . Asian Americans also lean Democratic by a wide margin ( 65 % -23 % ) . This data for Asian Americans is based on interviews conducted in English . Back to top
For Gen Xers , who came of age during a period of high immigration , the pattern holds , but is not quite as stark . In 1998 , when they were ages 18 to 33 , half of Hispanic Gen Xers were U.S. born , compared with a 41 % U.S.-born share when they were ages 34 to 49 in 2014 .
American and German views on defense spending are generally similar , but there have been notable shifts in opinion in both countries over the last year . Americans have become less likely to say European allies should increase spending on national defense ( 39 % hold this view this year , down from 45 % in 2017 ) . Meanwhile , Germans have become more likely to say their country should increase defense spending ( 43 % have this opinion this year , up from 32 % in 2017 ) .
However , far fewer ( 63 % ) feel it is important to be able to `` go around in public without always being identified . '' Only 34 % believe being able to go unnoticed in public is `` very important '' and 29 % say it is `` somewhat important '' to them . In both cases , all adults , regardless of age or gender , express comparable views .
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff receives overwhelmingly negative ratings for her handling of important issues facing the country . And while about half say the president is having a positive influence on the way things are going in the country , this is in sharp contrast to opinions of Rousseff 's predecessor and supporter , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , in the last year of his two-term presidency . In 2010 , more than eight-in-ten ( 84 % ) said Lula was having a positive impact on Brazil .
People in many nations name China , not the U.S. , as the world 's leading economic power . A median of 48 % across the surveyed countries say this , while 34 % say the U.S. is the global economic leader .
As the debate over college admissions policies reignites , a new Pew Research Center survey finds that most Americans ( 73 % ) say colleges and universities should not consider race or ethnicity when making decisions about student admissions . Just 7 % say race should be a major factor in college admissions , while 19 % say it should be a minor factor . While majorities across racial and ethnic groups agree that race should not be a factor in college admissions , white adults are particularly likely to hold this view : 78 % say this , compared with 65 % of Hispanics , 62 % of blacks and 58 % of Asians . ( Asians were interviewed in English only ; for more details , please see `` Race in America 2019 . '' )
Immigrants in the U.S. as a whole have lower levels of education than the U.S.-born population . In 2018 , immigrants were over three times as likely as the U.S. born to have not completed high school ( 27 % vs. 8 % ) . However , immigrants were just as likely as the U.S. born to have a bachelor 's degree or more ( 32 % and 33 % , respectively ) . Educational attainment varies among the nation 's immigrant groups , particularly across immigrants from different regions of the world . Immigrants from Mexico and Central America are less likely to be high school graduates than the U.S. born ( 54 % and 47 % , respectively , do not have a high school diploma , vs. 8 % of U.S. born ) . On the other hand , immigrants from every region except Mexico , the Caribbean and Central America were as likely as or more likely than U.S.-born residents to have a bachelor 's or advanced degree .
After exhibiting relatively strong growth between early 2005 and early 2006 , home broadband adoption in 2006 - 2007 grew at its slowest rate in recent years . As of March 2007 , 47 % of adult Americans say they have a high-speed connection at home , up from 42 % in early 2006 . This 12 % year-to-year growth rate is much lower than the 40 % rate in the previous period .
Across the 38 nations in the survey , a median of just 9 % view the countries of the EU as the world 's leading economic power . By comparison , 42 % name the U.S. and 32 % name China , while an additional 7 % name Japan .
Newt Gingrich holds a substantial 35 % to 21 % lead over Mitt Romney among Republican and Republican-leaning independent voters who say they are very likely to vote in the GOP primaries or caucuses . But clear majorities say there is at least a chance they would vote for either Gingrich or Romney in Republican primaries in their state . None of the other Republican candidates draws nearly as much potential support . Just 18 % of likely Republican primary voters say there is no chance they could support Gingrich and only somewhat more ( 26 % ) say there is no chance they could vote for Romney . More than four-in-ten likely Republican primary voters have effectively ruled out voting for the other GOP candidates .
White evangelical Protestants express strong support for Republican candidates , just as they have in recent elections . Two-thirds of registered voters who are white evangelical Protestants in the new survey say they would vote Republican ( 67 % ) , compared to 22 % who would vote for a Democrat .
One area where it appears that Republicans who rely most on Trump for COVID-19 news have heard his message is how susceptible people under the age of 18 are to becoming infected with the virus – a subject that has often surfaced in debates over reopening schools this fall . The president has at times claimed that the risk to young people is minimal ; the CDC says it is `` unclear '' whether children are as susceptible to infection as adults . Around six-in-ten Republicans ( including leaners ) who rely most on Trump and the task force for COVID-19 news ( 57 % ) say people under 18 are far less susceptible to becoming infected than adults , while 30 % say they are about as susceptible . But Republicans who do n't rely the most on Trump for coronavirus news are much more divided : 39 % say young people are far less susceptible than adults , and 41 % say they are about as susceptible .
The rise in the share of voters saying voting will be easy since August is largely attributable to shifting views among Biden voters . In August , more Biden voters said that voting would be difficult ( 60 % ) than easy ( 40 % ) . Today , 62 % of Biden voters say they expect voting will be easy .
English proficiency is rising among Hispanics ages 5 and older . In 2015 , 69 % of Hispanics said they speak only English at home or indicate that they speak English `` very well '' , up from 59 % who said the same in 1980 . Most of this growth has been driven by U.S.-born Hispanics , whose English proficiency share has grown from 71.9 % in 1980 to 89.7 % in 2015 . By contrast , English proficiency among foreign-born Hispanics has seen little change over the same period . In 2015 , just 34.6 % of foreign-born Hispanics reported that they speak only English at home or speak English `` very well '' , a slight increase from 30.7 % in 1980 .
Nearly half of Republicans ( 47 % ) say it is acceptable for officials to fault the administration 's response , while slightly more ( 52 % ) find this unacceptable . Democrats overwhelmingly think it is acceptable for elected officials to criticize how the administration has addressed the outbreak ( 85 % say this ) .
Among all Republicans and GOP leaners , unfavorable views of Boehner rose seven points among those who agree with the Tea Party between July and October ; the rise was comparable ( eight points ) among non-Tea Party Republicans .
Public interest in news about the Olympics rivaled that of the presidential campaign last week . Roughly one-in-four Americans followed each of these two stories very closely and approximately one-in-five said that either the campaign ( 21 % ) or the Olympics ( 20 % ) was the story they followed most closely last week . In terms of news coverage , campaign reporting exceeded Olympic coverage by more than double ( 24 % vs. 11 % ) , but there were significant differences between media sectors . The campaign was the biggest story in three-out-of-five sectors ( cable TV , network television and on radio ) , while the Olympics was the number one story in newspaper and online coverage .
As Americans receive information about the coronavirus outbreak from various international sources , majorities say they trust data from the European Union and WHO , but most are wary of information coming from the Chinese government . Only 15 % of U.S. adults say they trust information from Beijing at least a fair amount .
Fully 71 % say a failure of Republicans and Democrats to work together over the next two years would hurt the nation `` a lot '' and 16 % say it will hurt `` some . '' While the negative impact of political gridlock is seen as being most acute for the country as a whole , 45 % say they would be hurt a lot personally by an absence of partisan cooperation , and 28 % would be hurt some . Notably , there are only minimal partisan differences in these opinions .
Globally , a median of just 34 % express a favorable view of Russia , while about a quarter ( 26 % ) have confidence in Putin to do the right thing in world affairs . In only four countries – the Philippines , Tunisia , South Korea and Greece – do at least half have a positive view of Russia . By contrast , majorities in North America and much of Europe see Russia in a negative light . Attitudes toward Putin follow a similar pattern , with the Philippines and Tunisia the only countries where more than half express confidence in the Russian leader . These views notwithstanding , many say Russia 's international stature is growing . A median of roughly four-in-ten ( 42 % ) believe Russia is playing a more important role in the world today compared with 10 years ago . A smaller share sees Russia holding its ground ( 28 % ) , while just 19 % say Moscow 's influence is waning . Russia 's increased influence in world affairs is felt more in Europe , North America and the Middle East than in the Asia-Pacific , Latin America or sub-Saharan Africa . Among the countries surveyed , Greeks and Israelis are especially likely to say that Russia 's global stature has grown .
There is also widespread pessimism about the economic future . Majorities in most of the nations polled say that when children in their country grow up , they will be worse off financially than their parents , including eight-in-ten people in France who hold this view . Poland again stands out as having more positive views : 59 % of Poles are optimistic about the next generation 's economic prospects .
On only one item – perceptions of the economic impact of immigrants – are the least financially secure more conservative than those who are better off : 44 % of the least secure say immigrants are a burden on the U.S. because `` they take our jobs , housing and health care . '' That is considerably higher than the share of the most financially secure ( 27 % ) who express this view . Yet negative views about immigrants are more strongly correlated with vote preference among the financially secure than among the insecure .
The share of the Hispanic population that is eligible to vote varies greatly by state . About 71 % of Maine 's Hispanic population is eligible to vote , as is 68 % of Montana 's , the highest shares in the country . Among states with the largest Hispanic populations , about half or more of Hispanics are eligible to vote in Florida ( 56 % ) , California ( 51 % ) and Texas ( 50 % ) . The two states with the lowest shares of eligible voters among their Hispanic populations are North Carolina ( 34 % ) and Tennessee ( 33 % ) .
An 83 % majority of the public says vaccines for diseases such as measles , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) are safe for healthy children , while about one-in-ten ( 9 % ) think such vaccines are not safe . An additional 7 % volunteer that they do n't know .
Overall , observations related to users ' personal or professional lives are the most popular types of updates , while location-based tweets and links to videos are the least commonly mentioned :
Most people vote , but they participate in relatively few other political activities . Whether they are required to by national law or they do so out of civic duty , most people in emerging and developing countries vote . A median of 78 % say they have voted at some point , more than double the amount of any other political activity tested , including attending campaign events and protesting . Participation in online political activities is low – just 7 % say they have posted links to political articles and 9 % have posted online political comments .
One reason mothers are more likely than fathers to say it 's harder to get ahead in the workplace may be that women are much more likely than men to experience a variety of family-related career interruptions . About four-in-ten working mothers ( 42 % ) say that at some point in their working life , they had reduced their hours in order to care for a child or other family member , while just 28 % of working fathers say they had done the same ; almost as many working mothers ( 39 % ) say they had taken a significant amount of time off from work for one of these reasons , compared with about a quarter ( 24 % ) of working fathers . And mothers are more likely than fathers to say they quit their job at some point for family reasons , by 27 % to 10 % .
Republicans see more risk than Democrats when it comes to the economic effects of climate policies . Around half of Republicans ( 52 % ) said in 2019 that such policies hurt the economy . In contrast , most Democrats said climate policies either help ( 47 % ) or make no difference ( 38 % ) to the economy .
There is somewhat more change among political independents than among partisans . However , 78 % of those who did not identify as Republicans or Democrats in December 2015 also did not affiliate with either party in March 2017 . Among the remaining 22 % , nearly equal shares ended up identifying as Democrats ( 12 % ) and Republicans ( 10 % ) . Among nonpartisans who leaned toward a party in December 2015 , roughly six-in-ten leaned toward the same party in March of this year . There was more movement during this period among leaners than partisans . For instance , 16 % of those who initially leaned Republican eventually called themselves Democrats ( either identified or leaned Democratic ) ; a comparable share of those who initially leaned Democratic became Republicans or Republican leaners ( 14 % ) .
Virtually all Indians ( 95 % ) agreed that women should be able to work outside the home . But more than eight-in-ten ( 84 % ) said that when jobs are scarce , men `` should have more right to a job than women . '' That response made India stand out – it was among the highest percentages in the nations surveyed ; a similar percentage ( 82 % ) said this in Pakistan .
Although Lebanese Muslims consider Islam an important part of their lives , they place less emphasis on their faith than do Muslims elsewhere . In the six predominantly Islamic countries surveyed , Muslims in Lebanon are the least likely to say religion is very important in their life — just over half ( 54 % ) say religion is very important , compared with 69 % of Muslims in Turkey , 86 % in Jordan , and more than 90 % in Indonesia , Pakistan , and Morocco .
More than twice as many Republicans view Netanyahu favorably ( 53 % ) as unfavorably ( 21 % ) ; 26 % have no opinion . By contrast , Democrats hold mixed views of Netanyahu ( 28 % favorable vs. 35 % unfavorable ) ; 37 % have no opinion . Independents ' opinions of Netanyahu mirror those of the overall public ( 38 % favorable , 26 % unfavorable , 36 % no opinion ) .
Meanwhile , smartphones are still relatively rare , although significant minorities own these devices in countries such as Lebanon , Chile , Jordan and China .
At the same time , the Greek public does not expect the economic situation in their country to improve . A majority of the Greeks ( 64 % ) were pessimistic about the economy 's future in the next year and 54 % believed their personal situation will be worse in the next 12 months .
As news about Ebola dominates the airwaves and permeates midterm campaigns , Americans are following the ongoing story at historically high rates . About half of U.S. adults ( 49 % ) followed Ebola news very closely last week , elevating the story to our list of most-followed events since 2010 .
As for types of games that Americans like to play , strategy and puzzle games are the most popular among those included in the survey . About six-in-ten adults who say they play video games often or sometimes report that they typically play these types of games ( 62 % each ) . Adventure , shooter , role-playing , team sport or racing and simulation games are all somewhat less commonly played , with about half of video game players or fewer saying they typically play these types of games .
In December , a majority of the public ( 82 % ) also said Trump should be more cautious in `` the kinds of things he says and tweets '' once he becomes president . Just 15 % said there is no need for him to change .
Among non-gun owners , mothers are much more likely than fathers to say they have talked with their children about gun safety ( 58 % vs. 37 % ) . And while 59 % of white parents who do n't own guns say they have talked with their children about gun safety , 40 % of nonwhite parents who do n't own guns say they have done this .
When asked about the health care law 's future , 49 % of Americans say they think the law 's major provisions are probably `` here to stay '' while 43 % say they probably will be eliminated . As expected , opinions about the law 's fate are linked to underlying views of the ACA . Still , about a quarter of the law 's supporters ( 27 % ) say its major provisions may be eliminated , while 67 % say they are probably `` here to stay . '' Conversely , a third of ACA opponents ( 36 % ) say key aspects of the law will likely remain in place ; 55 % expect them to be eliminated .
After the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s , Israel 's largest wave of Jewish immigrants arrived from Russia and other former Soviet republics . These immigrants , who have far outnumbered those from other countries since Israel achieved statehood , were able to come because of Israel 's Law of Return , which allows all Jews around the world to immigrate and receive immediate citizenship . Israeli Jews support this right virtually unanimously . Religiously , the vast majority of FSU-born Jews in Israel ( 81 % ) self-identify as secular ( Hiloni ) , compared with 49 % of all Israeli Jews . This fact is evident when it comes to their views about religion and politics : FSU Jews are adamantly against religious involvement in government . About eight-in-ten say , generally , that religion should be kept separate from government policies ( 79 % ) , and similar shares oppose , specifically , making halakha ( Jewish law ) the state law for Jews in Israel ( 81 % ) and shutting down public transportation on the Sabbath ( 81 % ) . Fewer Israeli Jews overall take these positions .
These policy debates are occurring at a time when roughly nine-in-ten Americans describe high-speed internet service as either essential ( 49 % ) or important but not essential ( 41 % ) . Only about one-in-ten Americans say that high-speed internet access is either not too important ( 6 % ) or not important at all ( 3 % ) . Republicans and Democrats tend to agree that broadband is important , but Democrats are more likely to say it is essential : 58 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners describe broadband in this way , compared with 38 % of Republicans and Republican leaners . A similar split is evident by race and ethnicity , with blacks ( 55 % ) and Hispanics ( 61 % ) more likely than whites ( 45 % ) to say that high-speed access at home is essential .
Decades after internet access became widely available , Pew Research Center surveys show that about a tenth of American adults ( 12 % ) remain offline . But what happens when some of them take the plunge and connect ? A new analysis provides a glimpse of the online behaviors of those who are new to the internet . The Center provided internet-connected tablet computers to 112 people who are members of our American Trends Panel . These panelists , who previously received our surveys through the mail , had never used the internet under any circumstances . This change allowed these respondents to become internet users if they wished by using the tablets for online activities other than taking surveys .
Donald Trump receives generally negative ratings from the public across a range of personal traits and characteristics . Just 24 % of Americans say Trump is even-tempered , while nearly three times as many ( 70 % ) say that description does not apply to him . Fewer than half say that Trump is a strong leader ( 43 % ) , well-informed ( 38 % ) , empathetic ( 36 % ) or trustworthy ( 34 % ) .
Money sent by immigrants to their home countries in sub-Saharan Africa reached a record $ 41 billion in 2017 . This represents a 10 % jump in remittances from the previous year , the largest annual growth for any world region , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of World Bank data .
Overall , 72 % say there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally , if certain requirements are met ; far fewer ( 27 % ) say there should not be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally . The share who supports a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants has edged lower since March 2017 ( from 77 % ) , driven by a shift in Republican views . Among Republicans and Republican leaners , 54 % say there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally , compared with 45 % who say there should not be a path to legal status . In March 2017 , Republicans supported a path to legal status by a wider margin ( 61 % to 38 % ) .
On this issue , Americans vary in their perceptions that people often pretend to be someone else to try to steal information in this way . About half of women say this , compared with a smaller share of men . Roughly six-in-ten Black adults ( 63 % ) say the same , compared with 56 % of Hispanic adults , 45 % of White adults and 35 % of Asian adults . And those with relatively low incomes are more likely to think people do this often ( 57 % say so ) compared with smaller shares of those with higher incomes .
Interest in the 2008 presidential campaign remained steady last week : 21 % of the public followed campaign news very closely and 12 % listed this as their most closely followed story . As has been the case throughout most of the year , Democrats paid closer attention to the campaign than did Republicans . This past week , the gap was particularly large with 30 % of Democrats and 13 % of Republicans paying very close attention to campaign news .
Americans also are using less water in their homes , which indirectly addresses climate change . ( As the EPA notes , `` It takes lots of energy to pump , treat , and heat water , so saving water reduces greenhouse gas emissions . '' ) According to our analysis of data from the U.S. Geological Survey , average residential water use was 87.5 gallons per person per day in 2010 ( the latest year for which data are available ) . That 's nearly 21 % below the average use figure for 1980 , the peak year .
Nearly all Orthodox Ethiopians ( 98 % ) say religion is very important to them , compared with a median of 34 % of Orthodox saying this across 13 countries surveyed in Central and Eastern Europe . About three-quarters of Orthodox Ethiopians say they attend church every week ( 78 % ) , compared with a median of 10 % in Central and Eastern Europe and just 6 % in Russia .
The weekly News Interest Index survey was being conducted when the Jan. 8 shootings in Tucson occurred . Before the rampage , Americans said they were tracking news about the economy most closely , but in the survey 's fourth and final day – the Sunday following the horrific events in Arizona – 34 % said they were following news about the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords most closely , double the 17 % that said they were following news about the economy most closely .
Most Russians say that Western sanctions are having an effect on their economy , and nearly half ( 47 % ) say it is a major effect . This concern is little changed from surveys in 2015 and 2017 . Relatedly , 80 % of Russians see NATO as a military threat , with 45 % stating it is a major threat . Similar sentiments toward the organization were shared in 2015 and 2017 .
Eight-in-ten Americans ( 80 % ) report that they reduce their food waste for environmental reasons . Large shares of the public ( 72 % ) say they use fewer plastics that can not be reused such as plastic bags , straws , cups or reduce their water consumption ( 68 % ) to help the environment .
The importance of most of these elements to Hispanic identity decreases across generations . For example , 54 % of foreign-born Hispanics say speaking Spanish is an essential part of what being Hispanic means to them , compared with 44 % of second-generation Hispanics and 20 % of third- or higher-generation Hispanics .
The largest differences are by party , and they are especially significant . CPC supporters ( 72 % ) are far more likely to favor building the pipeline , compared with only 45 % of Liberals and an even smaller share of NDP followers ( 22 % ) . The NDP won provincial elections in Alberta in May and opposes construction of the pipeline . However , Albertans do not share the NDP 's opinion . Nearly two-thirds ( 65 % ) in Alberta favor building the pipeline through their oil sands region , while only 38 % support it in Ontario and British Columbia and 31 % in Quebec .2
Puzzle and strategy games are the most popular genres among those who often or sometimes play video games . Around six-in-ten of these adults play puzzle and strategy games ( 62 % play each type ) , according to the 2017 survey . Meanwhile , 49 % play adventure games , 42 % play shooter games , 39 % play role-playing games , 33 % play team sport or racing games and 32 % play simulation games . Women who often or sometimes play video games are more likely than men to play puzzle games ( 72 % vs. 52 % ) . This genre is also more popular among game players ages 65 and older than among those ages 18 to 29 ( 74 % and 56 % of whom , respectively , play puzzle games ) .
Whites and blacks are split over the current state of race relations and what progress Obama has made on the issue . About six-in-ten blacks ( 61 % ) say race relations are generally bad , while about equal shares of whites say race relations are good as say they 're bad . Overall views on race relations are more positive now than they were a year ago , following the unrest in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray , a black man who died while in police custody . Even so , the public 's views of race relations are more negative now than they have been for much of the 2000s .
Putin 's 2015 decision to intervene in the Syrian conflict was a momentous change in Russia 's foreign policy . Today , the prevailing view among Russians is that their country should stay the course in Syria , keeping Russia 's military involvement at its current level ( 46 % ) . Among those who would like to see a change in Russia 's stance , roughly three times as many support decreasing the level of Russia 's involvement ( 34 % ) , as opposed to increasing it ( 11 % ) . When asked about the purpose of their country 's military actions in Syria , majorities say limiting casualties ( 72 % ) and defeating extremist groups ( 64 % ) should be priorities , compared with just a quarter who say the same about the Kremlin 's apparent goal of keeping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in power .
The vast majority of Americans – 96 % – now own a cellphone of some kind . The share of Americans that own smartphones is now 81 % , up from just 35 % in Pew Research Center 's first survey of smartphone ownership conducted in 2011 . Along with mobile phones , Americans own a range of other information devices . Nearly three-quarters of U.S. adults now own desktop or laptop computers , while roughly half now own tablet computers and roughly half own e-reader devices .
Democrats , regardless of ideology , support higher tax rates on corporations . But while 70 % of liberal Democrats say tax rates on household incomes over $ 250,000 should be raised , fewer than half of conservative and moderate Democrats ( 46 % ) say the same .
While most Americans say it 's good that more women are running for Congress this year , fewer than half say that , if there were more women there , Congress would do a better job of dealing with the country 's problems ( 39 % ) ; the tone of the political debate in Washington would be more respectful ( 36 % ) ; or that there would be more openness and transparency in government ( 34 % ) . About half or more say that the number of women in Congress does n't have much to do with each of these areas .
There is greater public support for cutting military spending in order to achieve deficit reduction . About half of Americans ( 51 % ) say reducing the deficit is more important than keeping military spending at current levels , while 40 % say deficit reduction is more important .
Fully 85 % of self-identified Catholics ages 18 - 29 said in a 2014 Pew Research Center survey that homosexuality should be accepted by society , compared with just 13 % who said it should be discouraged . Older age groups are less likely to favor acceptance . But even among Catholics ages 65 and older , 57 % say that homosexuality should be accepted .
While half of Americans believe China will emerge from the current crisis with less influence in world affairs , far fewer say this about the U.S. or the European Union .
While we do n't have much demographic information about the quiz-takers , we do know that they were much more likely than the general population to live in large cities or nearby suburbs , and less likely to live in a small city or town—and were half as likely as the national population to live in a rural area . This lines up with our previous research , which found that people who live in rural areas are more likely to be older and living in lower-income households , and likewise less likely to use libraries .
Many singles are open to dating someone who is different from them , but certain characteristics would give some people pause . Distance , debt and voting for Donald Trump top the list of reasons singles looking for a relationship would n't consider a potential partner , but there are other considerations , too . For example , 38 % say dating someone 10 years older than them would give them pause , and 36 % say the same about dating someone who is raising children from another relationship . Some of those looking for a relationship also say they definitely or probably would n't consider being in a relationship with someone who is a Republican ( 27 % of all daters ) , someone who voted for Hillary Clinton ( 26 % ) , someone who practices a different religion ( 23 % ) or someone who is a different race or ethnicity ( 15 % ) . Among daters looking for a relationship who are 28 and older , 27 % say they definitely or probably would n't consider a relationship with someone 10 years younger than them .
One possible reason for the gap : Two-thirds of the public ( 67 % ) say scientists do not have a clear understanding about the health effects of GM crops .
As smartphones and other mobile devices have become more widespread , 28 % of American adults now report that they go online `` almost constantly , '' up from 21 % in 2015 , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Jan. 8 to Feb. 7 , 2019 . Overall , 81 % of Americans say they go online on a daily basis . That figure includes the 28 % who go online almost constantly , as well as 45 % who say they go online several times a day and 9 % who go online about once a day . Some 8 % go online several times a week or less often , while 10 % of adults say they do not use the internet at all .
Regardless of whether they hope to see a female president , a majority of Americans ( 68 % ) say they expect there to be one in their lifetime . That number is down slightly since 2014 , when 73 % of the public said they thought the U.S. would elect a female president in their lifetime . Still , the share who say they think this is likely to happen is higher than in 1996 , when the question was first asked . At that time , only about half of Americans ( 54 % ) said they thought they would see a woman as president in their lifetime .
Fact Tank 's look at standardized test results around the world seemed to bear out these sentiments : U.S. students are improving – slowly – in math and science , but still lagging their peers internationally .
About nine-in-ten ( 89 % ) of those surveyed think of research scientists as intelligent . Three-quarters ( 75 % ) see scientists as focused on solving real-world problems . Similar shares say they consider scientists to be skilled at working in teams ( 72 % ) or honest ( 71 % ) .
The pattern of religious identity is another fundamental difference between the generations . Older generations identify overwhelmingly as Christian . For example , 85 % of the Silent generation identify as a member of a Christian denomination , while just 11 % say they are religiously unaffiliated ( defined as atheist , agnostic or `` nothing in particular '' ) . By contrast , smaller majorities of Millennials ( 56 % ) and Gen Xers ( 70 % ) identify as Christian , while as many as 35 % of Millennials and 23 % of Gen Xers do not identify with any organized religion . Over the past seven years , the share of the U.S. population that does not identify with an organized religion has grown since 2007 . Much of this change has occurred due to generational replacement ; the youngest adults who are aging into the population are more likely to be religiously unaffiliated than the oldest adults they are replacing .
A majority of U.S. adults ( 64 % ) say social media have a mostly negative effect on the way things are going in the country today , with Republicans being more likely than Democrats to express that view , according to a July 2020 survey . The Americans who see a negative effect from social media point to factors including misinformation and the hate and harassment they see on these platforms .
As Iranians prepare to elect a new president , the country 's international image is largely negative . Majorities in most of 39 countries surveyed have an unfavorable opinion of Iran , and most say Tehran does not respect the personal freedoms of its people . Meanwhile , any nuclear ambitions harbored by the Iranian government continue to draw strong opposition from Western countries , as well as neighboring states in the Middle East .
Roughly six-in-ten Americans ( 58 % ) say one very likely negative effect that will result from gene editing is that it will increase inequality because it will only be available for the wealthy . Another 54 % express concern that , even if gene editing is appropriate for certain purposes , it will lead to a slippery slope , with some using it in morally unacceptable ways . Far fewer Americans see upsides if gene editing for babies were to become widely available . About one-in-five ( 18 % ) consider it very likely that gene editing would pave the way for new medical advances that benefit society , and 16 % have a similar degree of confidence that it would help people live longer and better quality lives . Roughly a third or more consider each of these as not too or not at all likely to transpire .
About one-in-six adults ( 16 % ) who have been employed in the past two years say there was a time during this period when they needed or wanted to take time off from work following the birth or adoption of their child , to care for a family member with a serious health condition or to deal with their own serious health condition , but were unable to do so . This figure rises to 30 % among those with household incomes under $ 30,000 .
Teen cell phone owners in the 14 - 17 age group are slightly more likely to take photos than those ages 12 - 13 ( 85 % vs. 77 % ) . This older category of teens is also somewhat more likely to send/receive photos than the younger group of teens ( 67 % vs. 56 % ) . However , there is an interesting counter-trend , with more 12 - 13 year-olds sending/receiving video than those 14 and older ( 41 % vs. 27 % ) . Read more in Teens and Mobile Phones ( 2010 ) .
But the partisan divide on this question is more pronounced . About half of Republicans ( 53 % ) say immigrants coming to the U.S. make society worse in the long run , compared with just 24 % of Democrats .
Americans overwhelmingly support limits on political campaign spending , and most think new laws could effectively reduce the role of money in politics . And there is extensive support for reining in campaign spending : 77 % of the public says `` there should be limits on the amount of money individuals and organizations '' can spend on political campaigns ; just 20 % say they should be able to spend as much as they want . A somewhat smaller majority ( 65 % ) says that new campaign finance laws could be written that would be effective in reducing the role of money in politics , while 31 % say any new laws would not be effective .
Conservative Republicans and Republican leaners are far more likely to say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases than to say that it should be legal ( 77 % vs. 22 % ) . Among moderate and liberal Republicans , 57 % say abortion should be legal , while 41 % say it should be illegal . The vast majority of liberal Democrats and Democratic leaners support legal abortion ( 91 % ) , as do three-quarters of conservative and moderate Democrats ( 75 % ) .
The demographic profile of veterans is also expected to change in the coming decades , reflecting the shifting demographic profile of the military in general . Between 2013 and 2043 , the share of all veterans who are women will almost double , from 9 % up to 17 % , according to VA projections . At the same time , the share ages 50 to 69 is expected to shrink from 42 % to 34 % , while the share ages 70 or older is expected to rise from 30 % to 36 % . Mirroring trends in the overall U.S. population , the veteran population is predicted to become more racially and ethnically diverse , as well . Between 2013 and 2043 , the share of non-Hispanic white veterans is projected to fall from 78 % to 64 % , while the share of Hispanic vets will likely double , from 7 % to 14 % .
Trump has appointed more federal appeals court judges to date than any recent president at the same point in their presidency . The overall number of federal judges Trump has appointed to date ( 194 ) is similar to the number appointed by George W. Bush at the same juncture in his presidency ( 197 ) . Trump , however , stands out for his unusually large number of appeals court judges — the powerful regional jurists who have the final word on most appeals that do not end up in the Supreme Court and who frequently end up becoming Supreme Court justices themselves . Eight of the nine current high court justices , including both of Trump 's appointees , previously served as appeals court judges . Trump has appointed 53 appeals court judges to date , far higher than the number appointed by nearly every other recent president at the same point in their tenure . The exception is Carter , who successfully appointed 54 appeals court judges by July 7 of his fourth ( and final ) year in office .
Six origin groups – Chinese , Indian , Filipino , Vietnamese , Korean and Japanese – accounted for 85 % of all Asian Americans as of 2015 . These groups together largely shape the overall demographic characteristics of Asian Americans . The remaining 13 origin groups each made up 2 % or less of the nation 's Asian population . These groups have a variety of characteristics that can differ greatly from the largest groups .
Instead , Pew Research Center surveys show a preference for other terms to describe identity . A 2015 survey found that 50 % of Hispanics most often describe themselves by their family 's country of origin : 23 % use the terms Latino or Hispanic , and 23 % most often describe themselves as American . As for a preference between the terms Hispanic or Latino , the survey found that 32 % of Hispanics prefer `` Hispanic , '' 15 % prefer the term `` Latino '' and the rest ( 51 % ) have no preference .
During the first two years of the nation 's economic recovery , the mean net worth of households in the upper 7 % of the wealth distribution rose by an estimated 28 % , while the mean net worth of households in the lower 93 % dropped by 4 % , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of newly released Census Bureau data . From 2009 to 2011 , the mean wealth of the 8 million households in the more affluent group rose to an estimated $ 3,173,895 from an estimated $ 2,476,244 , while the mean wealth of the 111 million households in the less affluent group fell to an estimated $ 133,817 from an estimated $ 139,896 .
As of this past summer , roughly two-thirds of Americans said they would like to see tighter e-cigarette regulations . In a July 2019 Gallup survey , 64 % of U.S. adults said laws and regulations covering e-cigarettes should be made more strict , while around a quarter ( 26 % ) said regulations should stay as they are now . Just 5 % said these laws and regulations should be less strict . Younger Americans – those ages 18 to 29 – were split on laws surrounding e-cigarettes : While roughly half ( 49 % ) said laws should be made more strict , 42 % said laws should be kept as they are . By comparison , roughly two-thirds or more of older adult groups said regulations covering e-cigarettes should be made more strict .
When asked to describe QAnon , people most often mentioned that it was a group of some kind ( 41 % ) or a conspiracy group or theory ( 44 % ) . When Americans who said they had heard at least a little about QAnon were asked to write in their own words what they thought it was , they were most likely to describe it as a group of some kind or include a more specific description of it as a conspiracy group or theory . Far fewer wrote in other kinds of descriptions . Two-in-ten mentioned that it is a right-wing group or theory ( 20 % ) or that it is a theory about child abuse or trafficking ( 20 % ) . Another 16 % connected it directly to President Donald Trump , either by saying that Trump supports the group or that the group views him as a hero , savior or victim . ( Responses could fit into more than one of these categories . )
Across the six issues , more voters expect say things would not change much under Clinton than under Trump . Roughly a third of voters say that on issues ranging from security from terrorism ( 36 % ) to the budget deficit ( 31 % ) , things will not be much different in the years ahead than they are today . In assessing a possible Trump presidency , smaller percentages – no more than about one-in-five –expect little change on any issue .
Communal tensions – between Indians of various religious faiths and castes – have long plagued Indian society . Most Indians are at least somewhat concerned about these tensions , but even larger shares are worried about other national issues , according to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey . Almost four-in-ten Indians ( 37 % ) said `` communal relations '' are a very big problem in their country , while an additional 31 % named this as a moderately big problem . But greater shares of Indian adults named crime , terrorism , corruption , lack of employment opportunities , rising prices and other issues as major national problems .
The American public is closely divided over the degree of health risk posed by additives present in the foods we regularly eat . Majorities see at least some risk from eating food produced with common agricultural and processing practices , including meat from animals given hormones or antibiotics , produce grown with pesticides and foods with artificial ingredients . And about half of the public says that foods with genetically modified ( GM ) ingredients are worse for one 's health than foods without , according to a new nationally representative survey from Pew Research Center . The Pew Research Center survey finds the U.S. public of two minds about food additives . Roughly half say the average person faces a serious health risk from food additives over their lifetime ( 51 % ) while the other half believes the average person is exposed to potentially threatening additives in such small amounts that there is no serious risk ( 48 % ) . It 's important to keep in mind that the survey asks respondents for their views about food additives as a whole . There are more than 10,000 additives used to enhance the shelf life , appearance , taste or nutritional value of foods , including over 3,000 that are `` generally recognized as safe '' – a term defined by the Food and Drug Administration , the main federal agency charged with regulating food safety .1
As was the case throughout the presidential campaign , more Americans continue to oppose ( 62 % ) than favor ( 35 % ) building a wall along the entire U.S. border with Mexico . And while President Donald Trump has said the U.S. would make Mexico pay for the wall , the public is broadly skeptical : 70 % think the U.S. would ultimately pay for the wall , compared with just 16 % who think Mexico would pay for it .
The controversy over the millions of dollars in bonuses paid to AIG employees attracted considerable public interest last week . In fact , about as many people tracked that story very closely ( 50 % ) as followed news about the overall economy very closely ( 52 % ) . The AIG controversy was the most closely followed story of the week for 29 % of Americans , approaching that of the economic crisis overall ( 35 % ) .
Overall , few assess the American response to the coronavirus outbreak positively . In no country surveyed do more than a fifth think the U.S. has done at least a somewhat good job dealing with the virus , and a median of only 15 % across the 13 countries polled consider the country 's handling of the virus to be effective . On the flip side , in every country surveyed , roughly eight-in-ten or more say the U.S. has handled the virus badly . And , in 11 of the 13 countries surveyed , half or more say the U.S. has done a very bad job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak . These numbers are particularly low when compared to how publics think other countries and organizations have handled the outbreak . Consistently , the shares who think the U.S. has responded well to the virus are surpassed by those who think the same of China , the EU , the WHO and their own country . Only in Japan does the comparison between the U.S. and China coronavirus response come close : 15 % think the U.S. has done a good job dealing with the outbreak and 16 % think the same of China . In most countries , at least half or more believe their country has done a good job dealing with the virus . However , the U.S. and UK are notable outliers , with 47 % and 46 % of people in each country , respectively , saying their nation has done at least a somewhat good job dealing with the outbreak .
Democrats and Democratic leaners are 9 points more likely than last summer to say they are `` not at all '' confident in Trump to make wise decisions about the use of military force ( 68 % today , compared with 59 % last August ) . However , the combined share who say they are not too or not at all confident in Trump on this measure is about the same as it was last summer .
Contrasting Asia-Pacific views of China may in part be explained by differing levels of concern about regional territorial disputes with Beijing . The Filipinos ( 91 % concerned ) , Vietnamese ( 83 % ) and Japanese ( 83 % ) are the most troubled by these territorial frictions , according to a 2015 Pew Research Center survey of Asia-Pacific perceptions of various global threats . And they are also the three countries in the region with the highest unfavorable ratings of China .
The new data show that 4.32 million adults ( ages 18 or older ) were newlywed in 2012 , a 3 % percent increase over the 4.21 million adults newly married in 2011 . ( The data do not include same-sex couples . ) But a closer look at the demographic patterns reveals some interesting insights about who is getting married . From 2011 to 2012 , the total number of newly married adults increased by 113,000 ( from 4.21 million to 4.32 million ) . Examining the newlyweds by education level , the number of newly married adults with at least a bachelor 's degree increased by 98,000 from 2011 to 2012 . Thus , almost the entire increase in new marriages ( 87 % ) from 2011 to 2012 is accounted for by the college-educated .
By contrast , smaller religious groups may not have been harassed in as many countries simply because they are not present in as many countries . For instance , because of their dense concentration in a small number of countries , 99 % of Jews and Hindus lived in nations where members of their groups were harassed . And despite being one of the most geographically dispersed religious groups , 97 % of Muslims lived in countries where harassment of Muslims occurred in 2015 . ( By comparison , 78 % of Christians lived in places where Christians were harassed . )
The U.S. public renders a harsh judgment on the state of political discourse in the country today . Large majorities of Americans say the tone and nature of political debate has become more negative in recent years , as well as less respectful , less fact-based and less substantive . President Donald Trump is a major factor in people 's views : A 55 % majority says Trump has changed the tone and nature of political debate in the country for the worse . Fewer than half as many ( 24 % ) say he has changed it for the better , while 20 % say he has had little impact .
A 54 % majority of the American public said Ford would go down as an `` average '' president in a Gallup poll last year , while about equal shares thought history will remember him as outstanding or above average ( 21 % ) and below average or poor ( 19 % ) . A 2011 Pew Research poll asked adults to name the person who had done the best job as president over their lifetime . Less than 1 percent of adults named Ford , even when limited to those who were 18 or older during his presidency . No other president who had served since Herbert Hoover received fewer mentions ( Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan topped the list at 34 % and 25 % , respectively ) .
For most American mothers , part-time work would be their ideal work situation , preferred over full-time work or not working at all outside the home . However , there are sharp differences among views of mothers based on factors such as economic circumstances and marital status . Working part time has consistently been the top choice for women with at least one child under the age of 18 in the three years that the question was asked . Nearly half of mothers ( 47 % ) in 2012 said that their ideal situation would be to work part time . The share was 50 % in 2007 and 44 % in 1997 .
Turkey , as a nation , is generally popular in the countries surveyed . Majorities in all of the predominantly Muslim nations polled ( the Palestinian territories , Jordan , Lebanon , Egypt , Indonesia , and Pakistan ) express a favorable opinion of Turkey . But the country also receives a positive rating in much of Europe , including Russia ( 66 % favorable ) , France ( 61 % ) , Ukraine ( 58 % ) , and Britain ( 54 % ) .
Over the last several years , the Catholic population in the U.S. has shifted somewhat from the Northeast and Midwest toward the South and West regions of the country . Catholics still are more heavily concentrated in the Northeast than are Americans overall ( 26 % vs. 18 % ) . But between 2007 and 2014 , the shares of U.S. Catholics living in the Northeast and Midwest have each fallen by 3 percentage points ( from 29 % to 26 % and from 24 % to 21 % , respectively ) . And the shares living in the South and West have each increased by 3 points ( from 24 % to 27 % and from 23 % to 26 % , respectively ) .
Similarly , while 38 % of conservative Republicans , who make up about two-thirds of all Republicans and GOP leaners , express positive views of Trump 's conduct , only 20 % of moderate and liberal Republicans do so . And older Republicans , especially those 65 and older , are more likely than younger Republicans to say they like Trump 's conduct as president .
Yet the survey also shows that immigration is not a deal breaker issue for many Latino voters . Some 54 % say they would vote for a candidate who disagrees with them on immigration policy if that candidate agrees with them on most other issues . Nonetheless , about one-third ( 36 % ) say they would not vote for a candidate if they disagreed with the candidate on immigration policy .
Americans both see this problem and want to address it . Overwhelming majorities of both Trump ( 86 % ) and Biden ( 89 % ) supporters surveyed this fall said that their preferred candidate , if elected , should focus on addressing the needs of all Americans , `` even if it means disappointing some of his supporters . ''
There is evidence that some kind of flat fee – a networked microaccounting system rather than a pay-per-click system — might have better success in marketplace . We asked people if they had to pay for content from their favorite site , would they prefer a subscription that would allow them to access all the content from the site or a pay-as-you-go plan where they would pay only for the articles and features they wanted to see . A substantial majority of those with a favorite site ( 54 % ) opted for the subscription model while less than half as many ( 24 % ) picked the a la carte option .11
Overall , the public 's current ratings for government performance are more positive than negative on five of 12 issues , including keeping the country safe from terrorism , setting fair standards for workplaces and responding to natural disasters . The government 's ratings on four issues – poverty , immigration , health care and the environment – are , on balance , negative . On three other issues , the public 's views are more mixed . On alleviating poverty and managing immigration , in particular , sizable proportions ( 42 % and 38 % , respectively ) say the government does a very bad job . By comparison , just 6 % say the government does a very good job in helping people out of poverty and 7 % say it does very well in managing the immigration system .
Assessments of Obama 's efforts to solve major problems also divide along racial , age and educational lines . Blacks ( 60 % ) are much more likely than whites ( 31 % ) or Hispanics ( 38 % ) to say Obama has made progress on the problems facing the nation . Though roughly even shares of whites and Hispanics say Obama has made progress on these issues , Hispanics are much more likely than whites to say Obama tried , but failed to make progress ( 45 % vs. 29 % ) , while whites are more likely than Hispanics to say he made these problems worse ( 26 % vs. 8 % ) .
Costner 's fellow Southerners are among the strongest critics of the Supreme Court 's rulings on school prayer . More than seven-in-ten people ( 73 % ) living in the South say they disapprove of the high court 's decisions on the topic in the 2012 GSS . But many in Costner 's generation have a different view . Nationwide , about 56 % of those ages 18 - 29 say they approve of the ban on school prayer – by far the highest share of any age group .
The Center 's 2019 survey found that sizable majorities of Nigerians expressed positive views toward China on a variety of economic issues : 83 % said China 's growing economy is a good thing for their country , while a comparable share ( 82 % ) said Chinese investment is a good thing because it creates jobs in their country . In both cases , these shares were the highest out of the 11 emerging economies surveyed by the Center in 2019 .
On the television side , NewsHour derives its revenue from a variety of sources , including PBS , the Corporation for Public Broadcasting ( CPB ) and a mix of `` nonpublic '' streams such as corporations , individual giving and foundations . While the details about public sources of revenue were unavailable for this analysis , NewsHour did provide information about its breakdown of nonpublic funding . In 2018 , contributions from individuals comprised 13 % of total nonpublic funding . ( Information on whether the total amount of this funding rose or fell was also unavailable . )
In 2018 , Asian and white immigrants were much more likely than Hispanic and black immigrants to work in nonmechanical , high-skill occupations . For example , 42 % of Asian immigrants and 36 % of white immigrants worked in jobs where analytical skills are most important , such as chemical engineers and computer programmers , compared with 23 % of black immigrants and just 11 % of Hispanic immigrants . There were similar differences in jobs in which fundamental and managerial skills are most important . White immigrants were more likely than those in other groups to work in jobs prioritizing social skills . Hispanic immigrants are most likely to be employed in lower-skill nonmechanical occupations . In 2018 , the majority of Hispanic immigrants worked in occupations where analytical ( 57 % ) and fundamental ( 51 % ) skills are least important , and four-in-ten or more worked in occupations in which social or managerial skills are least important . These shares were significantly higher than those among other immigrant groups . For example , about one-in-five or fewer black , white and Asian immigrants were employed in occupations where social skills were least important .
Although equal employment rights is seen as one of the top policy issues in the community , relatively few LGBT adults report experiencing workplace discrimination directly , compared with some other forms of discrimination and exclusion . About one-in-five ( 21 % ) say they have been treated unfairly by an employer because of their sexual orientation or gender identity , ( 5 % say this happened within the past year and 16 % report that this happened but not within the past year ) . The experiences of different groups in the LGBT community vary : 26 % of gay men , 23 % of lesbians and 15 % of bisexuals say that they have been treated unfairly by an employer .
Support for the goals of the science marches is divided by political party . Republicans and Republican leaners oppose the goals of the science marches by a 47 % -25 % margin ; some 29 % are undecided about their views . Democrats and Democratic leaners support the goals of the marches by a 68 % -14 % margin , with 18 % undecided .
Overall , 83 % of Republicans and Republican leaners think the federal government 's aid package will help small businesses either a great deal ( 32 % ) or a fair amount ( 51 % ) . A smaller majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 60 % ) think small businesses will get at least a fair amount of help from the aid . Larger majorities of Republicans than Democrats also think state and local governments ( 77 % vs. 59 % ) and unemployed people ( 80 % vs. 57 % ) will get at least a fair amount of help from the federal response to the coronavirus outbreak .
Three-in-ten Americans ( 30 % ) say research on GM foods is often based on the best available evidence . An equal share of U.S. adults say desires of scientists to help their industries influence research findings on GM foods most of the time ; half ( 50 % ) of the public says this occurs some of the time . A 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering and Medicine suggests there is consensus among scientific experts that GM foods are safe . However , most Americans perceive considerable disagreement in the scientific community . Only a minority of Americans say that almost all ( 14 % ) or more than half ( 28 % ) of scientists agree that GM foods are safe to eat .
About half of the public ( 51 % ) express unfavorable views of Speaker of the House John Boehner , while 22 % have a favorable opinion of him ( 26 % hold no opinion ) . A smaller share of the public has an opinion of Senate Majority Leader McConnell ; however , about as many rate him favorably as Boehner ( 23 % ) and fewer ( 38 % ) have an unfavorable opinion of him ( 39 % have no opinion ) .
Clinton backers are solidly opposed regardless of strength of support for her candidacy . Fully 88 % of Clinton supporters express opposition , compared with 10 % who are in favor of a wall along the entire border with Mexico .
About six-in-ten Americans ( 61 % ) say that making the tax system more fair should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year . It ranks among the top 10 issue priorities , well above items like immigration or the environment , and nearly on par with perennially top-tier issues like education ( 65 % top priority ) . Democrats and independents rate this as a more critical issue than do Republicans , but half of Republicans say this should be a top priority in 2012 . About two-thirds of Americans with household incomes under $ 75,000 rate this as a top priority , compared with about half of those earning $ 75,000 or more .
There are sizable educational differences in early midterm vote preferences : Those with a postgraduate degree favor the Democratic candidate over the Republican by roughly two-to-one ( 62 % to 30 % ) and those with a four-year college degree favor the Democrat , 53 % to 40 % . Preferences are more divided among voters who do not have a college degree .
The United States stands out to many around the world as the country their own nation can rely on most , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . Pluralities or majorities in around half of the 17 countries where an open-ended question was asked named the U.S. as their most dependable ally going forward . At the same time , substantial shares of people in some countries also perceive Washington as their greatest threat .
Today , 72 % of Trump voters say that obstacles that once made it harder for women are now largely gone , up from 67 % in 2016 . By contrast , just 20 % of Biden voters currently say this – a modest decline from the 26 % among Clinton voters in 2016 .
Levels of personal trust are associated with race and ethnicity , age , education and household income . To explore these connections , we asked questions about people 's general trust or distrust in others , their sense of the exploitative tendencies or fairness of others , and their assessment of the overall helpfulness or selfishness of others . Then , we built a scale of personal trust and distributed people along a spectrum from least trusting to most trusting . About a fifth of adults ( 22 % ) display consistently trustful attitudes on these questions , and roughly a third ( 35 % ) express consistently wary or distrustful views . Some 41 % hold mixed views on core personal trust questions .1 There are some notable demographic variations in levels of personal trust , which , even in these new contexts , follow historic trends captured by the Center and other researchers . The share of whites who show high levels of trust ( 27 % ) is twice as high as the share of blacks ( 13 % ) and Hispanics ( 12 % ) . The older a person is , the more likely they are to tilt toward more trustful answers . The more education Americans have , and the greater their household income , the greater the likelihood they are high on the personal trust spectrum . Those with less income and education are markedly more likely to be low trusters .
Since 2018 , comparably small shares of registered voters in both parties have changed parties . About one-in-ten voters ( 9 % ) who affiliated with the Republican Party or leaned Republican in September 2018 now identify as Democrats or lean Democratic . An identical share of voters ( 9 % ) who two years ago identified as Democrats or leaned Democratic now align with the GOP .
The most common view among the 10 European countries surveyed is that cultural diversity is neither a plus nor a minus in terms of quality of life . In no nation does a majority say increasing diversity is a positive for their country . At most , roughly a third in Sweden ( 36 % ) , the UK ( 33 % ) and Spain ( 31 % ) describe growing racial , ethnic and national diversity in favorable terms . By contrast , more than half in Greece ( 63 % ) and Italy ( 53 % ) say that growing diversity makes their country a worse place to live . Roughly four-in-ten Hungarians ( 41 % ) and Poles ( 40 % ) agree .
About half of Americans ( 49 % ) say the slow pace in evaluating the safety and effectiveness of medical treatments is a big problem . Some 46 % say a big problem is that health care providers are too quick to order potentially unnecessary tests and procedures , 44 % cite new treatments being made available before we fully understand their effects and 42 % say new treatments are so complex that patients can not make informed decisions .
In Taiwan , people tend to have negative views when it comes to mainland China . Just 35 % of adults give positive marks to mainland China , while about six-in-ten hold unfavorable views . Still , when it comes to financial ties , about half say they support closer economic relations with the mainland ; 44 % oppose this idea .
We asked all respondents whether religion is gaining or losing influence in American life , and 72 % of U.S. adults ( including 70 % of the religiously unaffiliated ) said religion is losing influence . We then asked whether this is a good thing or a bad thing , and , not surprisingly , `` nones '' were much more likely than other major religious groups to say that the declining influence of religion in American life is a good thing . The results , however , were not completely one-sided . In fact , religiously unaffiliated people who perceive religion 's influence as declining were split on whether this is a good thing or a bad thing . About a third of `` nones '' overall ( 34 % ) said it is good that religion is losing influence , while a similar share ( 30 % ) said this is bad .
In addition , broad majorities in 31 of the 39 countries surveyed say the income gap has increased over the past five years . Reports of a rise in income inequality are particularly high in the advanced economies , where a median of 80 % say things have gotten worse , compared with medians of 70 % in the developing economies and 59 % in the emerging markets .
Just 9 % say they followed news about the economy – the second ranking story on the list – more closely than any other news . About a third ( 35 % ) say they followed news about the economy very closely . This topic garnered 6 % of coverage .
In his landslide re-election victory last night , New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie carried 51 % of the Latino vote , a 19 point increase from his performance in 2009 , according to exit polls .
While U.S. Jews have a strong attachment to Israel , they are divided in their assessment of Trump 's handling of the Israeli-Palestinian issue , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . Roughly four-in-ten ( 42 % ) say they think Trump is favoring the Israelis too much , while a similar share ( 47 % ) say he is striking the right balance between the Israelis and Palestinians . The rest either say he is favoring the Palestinians too much ( 6 % ) or they do n't know ( 4 % ) . By comparison , Christians in the United States are more likely to say Trump is striking the right balance between the Israelis and Palestinians ( 59 % ) than to say Trump favors the Israelis too much ( 26 % ) . Among evangelical Protestants , 72 % say they think Trump strikes the right balance between the Israelis and Palestinians , and just 15 % say Trump favors the Israelis too much .
Statist views were not limited to support for government spending . Major regulatory programs also received strong endorsements : Fully 70 % favored limitations and prohibitions on child labor , even if that required amending the Constitution . Even more ( 88 % ) endorsed a law that would prevent misleading food , cosmetic and drug advertising . By 52 % to 36 % , the public also supported an amendment that would allow greater congressional regulation of industry and agriculture — and , at least in war-time , federal control of `` all profits from business and industry '' was favored by a 64 % -to-26 % margin .
Of the three major presidential candidates , Mexicans are most positive about the PRI 's Enrique Peña Nieto . A 56 % -majority has a favorable opinion of Peña Nieto , compared with 38 % who see him unfavorably . The PAN 's Josefina Vazquez Mota and the PRD 's Andrés Manuel López Obrador are less popular , with only about a third expressing a favorable view of either candidate ( 36 % and 34 % , respectively ) . More than half express unfavorable views of López Obrador ( 60 % ) and Vazquez Mota ( 54 % ) .
Among U.S. adults who attend religious services at least a few times a year , Catholics are less likely than Protestants to say they have a `` very '' or `` somewhat '' close relationship with their clergy . Six-in-ten Catholics ( 61 % ) say this , compared with about eight-in-ten Protestants ( 78 % ) . Just 8 % of Catholics say they are very close with their clergy , compared with a quarter of Protestants . And while only 22 % of Protestants say they are not close with the clergy at their church , the share among Catholics is nearly twice as high ( 39 % ) . Among specific Protestant groups , those in the evangelical ( 80 % ) and historically black traditions ( 81 % ) are more likely than mainline Protestants ( 71 % ) to say their relationship with their clergy is at least somewhat close . All three Protestant groups , however , say they have a closer relationship with their clergy than Catholics do .
While Hungarians and other Europeans may not agree on refugees and minorities , there is wide consensus on the importance of democratic values . Large majorities in Hungary say it is very important to live in a country where each democratic principle we asked about is adhered to . In 2015 , a median across six EU nations showed similarly positive views . Hungarians are even more supportive of certain democratic principles than other Europeans . In 2015 , a median of 61 % across six EU nations said that living in a country where the media can report the news without state censorship was very important . In our 2016 survey , 70 % of Hungarians said the same . This high rating comes on the heels of years of criticism of the Orbán government 's handling of press freedom and low ratings for Orbán 's handling of the media ( only 30 % approve ) .
Their positive take on the U.S. does not keep the Japanese from taking a pessimistic view of their long-time ally 's trajectory on the world stage . About six-in-ten ( 61 % ) say the United States plays a less important and powerful role as a world leader today compared with 10 years ago . Just 7 % believe the U.S. plays a more important role , while 29 % say Washington is as important as a decade ago . Such Japanese sentiment about a longtime ally is striking : Only 39 % of the Chinese see the U.S. as less important than before .
When it comes to parenting , dads are harder on themselves than moms are , especially dads who say they do n't spend enough time with their children . Among working dads who say they spend too little time with their kids , only 49 % say they are doing an excellent or good job as a parent . In contrast , among dads who say they spend the right amount of time with their kids , 81 % give themselves high marks for their parenting .
From 2007 to 2010 , the median debt of households headed by an adult younger than 35 fell by 29 % , compared with a decline of just 8 % among households headed by adults ages 35 and older . Also , the share of younger households holding debt of any kind fell to 78 % , the lowest level since the government began collecting such data in 1983 .
Partisans have starkly different ideas about what steps the federal government should take to improve life in the future . Democrats and Republicans differ notably in the policies they believe the federal government should enact to improve life for future generations . About two-thirds of Republicans ( 65 % ) , for example , say reducing the number of undocumented immigrants coming into the U.S. should be a top priority for the federal government , but just 17 % of Democrats agree . And while 83 % of Democrats say providing high-quality , affordable health care for all should be a top priority , a much smaller share of Republicans ( 48 % ) agree .
Even among LGBT adults , a relatively small share in our survey said they could relate to transgender people : Only 15 % of gay men , 11 % of lesbians and 12 % of bisexuals said they share `` a lot '' of common concerns and identity with transgender adults .
Combined advertiser expenditures for the evening broadcast news programs , ABC 's World News Tonight , CBS Evening News and NBC Nightly News , were $ 518 million in 2018 , a decline of 6 % compared with 2017 , according to estimates from Kantar Media . ( This data reflects the amount of money paid by advertisers , rather than the amount of revenue actually earned by networks . )
There is a strong association between a voter 's level of political activism and the amount of campaign outreach they received in the month before the election . Voters who were more highly engaged in the campaign report that they were contacted much more often by campaigns than less engaged voters . And voters are much more likely than nonvoters to report receiving several different types of contact from political campaigns late in the presidential campaign . Three-in-ten nonvoters say they did n't receive any of the types of campaign communications asked about in the survey , and 20 % say they received just one type of contact .
In 2005 , 8 % of men and 6 % of women used social media . Starting in 2009 , women started using social media at slightly higher rates than men , although this balance has shrunk yet again in recent years . Today , 68 % of women and 62 % of men report social media usage , a difference that is not statistically significant .
The share of women sitting on the boards of Fortune 500 companies has more than doubled , from 9.6 % in 1995 to 22.2 % in 2017 .
But when they 're asked about the time they spend with their children , dads are much more likely than moms to say it 's not enough . About half ( 48 % ) of working dads say they spend too little time with their kids , compared with just 26 % of working moms . Most working moms ( 66 % ) say they spend the right amount of time with their kids .
The public sees China in less negative terms than Russia . Still , 43 % consider China a serious problem ( but not an adversary ) ; about a third ( 34 % ) say China is not much of a problem , while just 16 % consider China an adversary . The share that considers China an adversary has edged down 6 points since early 2017 . Adults younger than 50 are less likely than older adults to see China as a problem . Nearly seven-in-ten ( 68 % ) of those ages 50 and older view China as a serious problem ( 49 % ) or as an adversary ( 19 % ) . A smaller share of those ages 18 to 49 ( 51 % ) think of China as a serious problem ( 39 % ) or as an adversary ( 13 % ) ; 44 % of younger adults consider China not much of a problem . Among Republicans and Republican leaners , 68 % say China is a serious problem ( 46 % ) or an adversary ( 22 % ) . A smaller majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners see China in these terms ( 54 % ) , including just 11 % who think of China as an adversary .
Around the world , few people trust Russian President Vladimir Putin to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs . A global median of roughly one-in-four ( 26 % ) say they have confidence in the Russian leader . Doubts about Putin 's handling of foreign policy , however , do not necessarily coincide with perceptions of Russia as a security risk . Across 37 countries , a median of 31 % describe Russia 's power and influence as a major threat to their country – identical to the median percentage who say the same about China , and similar to the median share ( 35 % ) that sees America 's power and influence as a large threat .
Sub-Saharan Africans ( a median of 68 % ) , Middle Easterners ( 61 % ) and Asians ( 57 % ) also report that those in the upper echelons of society have too much political influence . There are only two countries in the survey where fewer than four-in-ten believe the wealthy wield too much power – China ( 38 % ) and Vietnam ( 37 % ) , two nations still ruled by officially Communist parties . Roughly a quarter in both countries believe the rich should have more influence on their political system than they currently do .
The two publics also have different perspectives on the core elements of the U.S.-German relationship . A 45 % plurality of Germans believe economic and trade ties are the most important component of the relationship , while just around one-third point toward shared democratic values . Only 16 % say security and defense ties are most important .
Nearly two-thirds ( 64 % ) of parents of three or more children say the teaching of religious faith is important ( and 40 % rate it among the most important qualities to teach children ) . Smaller shares of parents with two children ( 55 % ) and one child ( 52 % ) view instilling faith as important ; about a third of those with two children ( 34 % ) and just 22 % of those with one child view it among the most important qualities to teach children .
Democrats and Republicans in counties that have been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak in recent weeks are more likely than their counterparts in places that were hit hard earlier in the pandemic or that have not been as hard hit to say K-12 schools in their area should provide online instruction five days a week in the fall . Still , there are large partisan differences in counties that have been hard hit and in those that have n't .
In fact , it 's the Nixon-era 's 18-year-olds , who were born in the middle of the Baby Boom and were ages 56 - 61 last election , who are more Democratic-leaning . In 2012 , their margin of support for Obama exceeded the national average by 5 points .
These demographic gaps are little changed over the course of the last few years . Americans ages 65 and over are the most positive in their evaluations of the economy , with 70 % saying it is in excellent or good shape . By comparison , about half of 18 - 29 year olds ( 47 % ) say the same . And while more than six-in-ten white people ( 64 % ) offer positive evaluations of the economy , that compares with roughly half of Hispanic people ( 49 % ) and just a third of black Americans ( 33 % ) .
Two-thirds of Americans ( 67 % ) say it is very or somewhat important to establish a way for most immigrants in the country illegally to remain here legally , according to the survey , which comes as the Supreme Court evaluates the Trump administration 's decision to end a program that has protected from deportation nearly 800,000 unauthorized immigrants who arrived in the United States as children . Sizable majorities of Americans also rate other policy goals as important : 68 % say it is very or somewhat important to increase security along the U.S.-Mexico border , and 73 % say it is important to take in refugees escaping war and violence . The public is more closely divided on the importance of increasing deportations of unauthorized immigrants , with 54 % saying this is a very or somewhat important goal and 45 % saying it is not too or not at all important .
In addition , there continue to be demographic differences in opinions about the law . By about two-to-one , women are more likely to say they approve ( 61 % ) than disapprove ( 31 % ) of the law . Men are more divided : Half approve , while 45 % disapprove .
When it comes to climate change and evolution , a majority of adults see scientists as generally in agreement that the earth is getting warmer due to human activity ( 57 % ) or that humans have evolved over time ( 66 % ) , though a sizeable minority see scientists as divided over each . Perceptions of where the scientific community stands on both climate change and evolution tend to be associated with individual views on the issue .
Americans are more likely than ever to get news from multiple social media sites , according to a recent Pew Research Center report . About a quarter of all U.S. adults ( 26 % ) get news from two or more social media sites , up from 15 % in 2013 and 18 % in 2016 . But there is considerable variation in the extent to which each site 's news users get news from other sites , and which sites those are .
Liberal Democrats ( who constitute about a third of all Democratic voters ) have distinctly different preferences for the party 's presidential nomination when compared with those who are very liberal . Nearly identical shares of liberal Democrats name Biden ( 25 % ) , Warren ( 23 % ) and Sanders ( 22 % ) as their first choice for the nomination . Among very liberal Democratic voters , Sanders ( 38 % ) and Warren ( 30 % ) outpace the other candidates . Biden receives only about half as much support from very liberal Democrats ( 12 % ) as he does from liberals ( 25 % ) . The preferences of conservative and moderate Democrats are less divided . Biden holds a substantial advantage : 30 % of moderate and conservative Democrats favor Biden , while 15 % back Sanders and smaller shares favor other candidates .
Of all U.S. advertising revenue , 28 % comes from digital ads . For most legacy news sectors , digital ad revenue represents a much smaller fraction of their total intake , despite years of experimentation . Just 4 % of local TV advertising revenue comes from digital , according to estimates from market research firm BIA/Kelsey , and this is not projected to grow much over the next five years . Newspapers see about 18 % of their total ad revenue from digital , according to BIA/Kelsey , and this does not at present make up for falling print revenue . Even for digital-native news organizations , high levels of digital revenue are no guarantee of profitability .
Six-in-ten adults say the public K-12 education system has a lot of responsibility in making sure the U.S. workforce has the right skills and education to be successful in today 's economy , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in association with the Markle Foundation in 2016 . The only entity or institution that more people say has a lot of responsibility is `` individuals themselves , '' cited by 72 % of adults . Americans express a bit more ambivalence toward the role of colleges and universities in workforce preparation , with around half of adults ( 52 % ) saying these higher-education institutions should have a lot of responsibility in making sure workers have the right skills and education to succeed . About half ( 49 % ) say employers should have a lot of responsibility in this role , but people are less likely to assign a lot of responsibility to state ( 40 % ) and federal governments ( 35 % ) .
Consider the findings of the Facebook study in which they varied how many positive and negative posts from friends test subjects were allowed to see . Posts were determined to be positive or negative if they contained a single positive or negative word . Then , the test subject 's own use of positive and negative words in their status updates was monitored for a week . In all , test subjects posted a total 122 million words , four million of which were positive and 1.8 million negative .
Despite often sizable subgroup differences , Asian Americans are distinctive as a whole , especially when compared with all U.S. adults , whom they exceed not just in the share with a college degree ( 49 % vs. 28 % ) , but also in median annual household income ( $ 66,000 versus $ 49,800 ) .
Liberal Democrats are more likely than moderate or conservative Democrats to say they are very concerned about the influence made-up news could have during the election ( 58 % vs. 40 % ) . Similarly , conservative Republicans are more likely than moderate or liberal Republicans to say this ( 57 % vs. 38 % ) .
On Thursday , the White House announced its latest step in policy toward Cuba by ending a long-standing policy that treated Cubans seeking to enter the U.S. differently from other immigrants . Under the old policy , Cubans hoping to legally live in the U.S. needed only to show up at a port of entry and pass an inspection , which included a check of criminal and immigration history in the U.S. After a year in the country , they were allowed to apply for legal permanent residence . The new policy makes Cubans who attempt to enter the U.S. without a visa subject to removal , whether they arrive by sea or port of entry . Overall , 56,406 Cubans entered the U.S. via ports of entry in fiscal year 2016 , up 31 % from fiscal 2015 when 43,159 Cubans entered the same way , according to the latest U.S. Customs and Border Protection data . Fiscal 2015 saw an even larger surge , as Cuban entries jumped 78 % over 2014 , when 24,278 Cubans entered the U.S. And those 2014 numbers had already increased dramatically from previous years after the Cuban government lifted travel restrictions that year .
Reagan is the top choice among Boomers ( ages 54 to 72 ) and Silents ( ages 73 to 90 ) ; about four-in-ten in the two older generations name Reagan ( 42 % of Boomers , 38 % of Silents ) . But within both generations , there are a range of opinions , with Obama , Kennedy , Clinton and Trump all receiving mentions from 15 % or more Boomers and Silents .
Friends and family are an important source of news , but Americans still count more on news organizations . Online news consumers are about twice as likely to often get news online from news organizations as they are from friends and family , and they find that news somewhat more accurate and just as near to their interests . Beyond just online news , Americans place as much trust in the information they get from news organizations as they do in information coming from family and friends – though there is a not a lot of trust placed in either . Only about two-in-ten trust information from local or national news organizations `` a lot , '' and 14 % say the same of information from family and friends . At least three-quarters express some or a lot of trust in the information from each .
Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to express support for journalists ' use of anonymous sources , though majorities of both parties think they are acceptable , at least in moderation . Roughly nine-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents ( 92 % ) say that it is acceptable for journalists to use anonymous sources , as do about seven-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners ( 71 % ) . But like Americans overall , most in each party say anonymous sources should be used only in special cases . While fewer in each party say it is always acceptable to rely on anonymous sources , Democrats are about three times as likely as Republicans to say this ( 22 % vs. 8 % ) . The relationship is nearly the inverse for the feeling that anonymous sources should be forbidden . Nearly three-in-ten Republicans ( 29 % ) think that it is never acceptable to use anonymous sources – 21 percentage points higher than Democrats who say the same ( 8 % ) .
5 Partisans have nearly opposite perspectives on whether the news of the past few weeks has been good for Trump or bad for him . A 55 % majority of Republicans say the news over the past couple of weeks has been very or mostly good for the president , while a 57 % majority of Democrats said it has been very or mostly bad for him . ( The survey was mostly conducted before concerns over the coronavirus escalated in the United States . )
A much larger share of Democrats than Republicans feel very coldly toward Russia – 54 % of Democrats compared with just 37 % of Republicans . Nearly identical shares in both parties say they feel somewhat coldly toward Russia ( 23 % of Republicans ; 22 % of Democrats ) .
Most supporters of both Clinton ( 62 % ) and Trump ( 59 % ) have only been contacted on behalf of the candidate they plan to vote for . In part this reflects the effectiveness of modern campaigns in targeting their mobilization efforts to those who support their candidate . About a third of Trump supporters ( 32 % ) and a quarter of Clinton backers ( 27 % ) have been reached by efforts on behalf of both campaigns , while very few have only been contacted on behalf of the candidate they do not back .
Across the countries surveyed , a median of 45 % say fewer or no immigrants should be allowed to move to their country , while 36 % say they want about the same number of immigrants . Just 14 % say their countries should allow more immigrants . ( Those who said no immigrants should be allowed volunteered this response . ) In Europe , majorities in Greece ( 82 % ) , Hungary ( 72 % ) , Italy ( 71 % ) and Germany ( 58 % ) say fewer immigrants or no immigrants at all should be allowed to move to their countries . Each of these countries served as some of the most popular transit or destination countries during Europe 's recent surge in asylum seekers . ( In several countries , most disapprove of how the European Union has handled the refugee issue . ) People in other countries around the world hold views similar to those in Europe . Large majorities in Israel ( 73 % ) , Russia ( 67 % ) , South Africa ( 65 % ) and Argentina ( 61 % ) say their countries should let in fewer immigrants . In every country surveyed , less than a third say their nation should allow more immigrants to enter .
An overwhelming majority of police officers ( 86 % ) said in 2016 that high-profile fatal encounters between black people and police officers had made their jobs harder . Sizable majorities also said such incidents had made their colleagues more worried about safety ( 93 % ) , heightened tensions between police and blacks ( 75 % ) , and left many officers reluctant to use force when appropriate ( 76 % ) or to question people who seemed suspicious ( 72 % ) .
Overall , the American public is closely divided between those expressing favorable and unfavorable views of China . But there are notable differences along partisan lines , with Democrats significantly more likely than Republicans or independents to offer a positive opinion of China . However , despite a 2016 presidential campaign season that featured a fair amount of negative rhetoric about China from then-candidate Trump and other GOP contenders , ratings have actually become more positive among Republicans . A year ago , 27 % had a favorable opinion , compared with 39 % today . Democrats also express more positive ratings this year ( 49 % favorable vs. 39 % in 2016 ) . Views among independents are essentially unchanged ( 41 % favorable vs. 40 % last year ) .
Solid Liberals make up a third of all Democrats and Democratic leaners – but close to half ( 48 % ) of politically engaged Democrats . That is about the same proportion as the other Democratic-leaning groups combined .
Young adults and part-time workers are especially likely to have been personally affected by workforce automation . In 2017 , 13 % of those ages 18 to 24 had either lost a job or had pay or hours reduced because their employers replaced their positions with a machine , robot or computer program . That compares with slightly smaller shares of those ages 30 and older . Those employed part time were also slightly more likely than those employed full time ( 11 % vs. 5 % ) to cite these personal impacts from automation .
Among cohabiters who are not currently engaged , half of those with a bachelor 's degree or more education and 43 % of those with some college experience say they saw moving in with their partner as step toward marriage . Smaller shares of those with a high school diploma or less education ( 28 % ) say the same .
Trump voters , who already were skeptical of the electoral process and prospects for an accurate vote count before the election in October , have become much more so since Biden 's victory . While a 59 % majority of all voters say elections in the United States were run and administered well , just 21 % of Trump supporters have a positive view of how elections were administered nationally . Among Biden supporters , 94 % say the elections were run and administered well .
Attitudes toward Iran are mostly negative worldwide . In 29 of 40 countries , a majority or plurality say they have an unfavorable opinion of the Islamic Republic . The only nations in which at least half express a favorable view are Bangladesh ( 63 % ) , Pakistan ( 63 % ) and Indonesia ( 51 % ) .
Roughly one-third of Canadians ( 35 % ) view their neighbor to the south positively . A similar share across Europe holds this view ( median of 33 % ) , though favorable opinions range from a low of roughly a quarter in Belgium ( 24 % ) and Germany ( 26 % ) to a high of about four-in-ten or more in the UK ( 41 % ) and Italy ( 45 % ) .
An analysis of voters living in areas with two or three major political contests this November shows that only 12 % of registered voters say they are splitting their vote between multiple political parties . About three-quarters of registered voters ( 74 % ) in these areas say they will select candidates from the same party for all major political races in their area , known as `` straight ticket '' voting .2
As the number of unauthorized immigrants shrank by 14 % from 2007 to 2017 , the U.S. lawful immigrant population continued to grow . During this period , the population of lawful U.S. immigrants – citizens and noncitizens , on permanent and temporary visas – rose by almost a quarter , to 35.2 million . Unauthorized immigrants were 23 % of the 45.6 million foreign-born residents in the U.S. in 2017 .
About six-in-ten Americans ( 61 % ) say it 's a good thing that more women are running for U.S. Congress this year than in the past , while a third say this is neither good nor bad . Just 5 % see this as a bad thing .
The share of countries with `` high '' or `` very high '' levels of social hostilities involving religion remained stable at 27 % . Countries in these two categories scored at least a 3.6 on the Social Hostilities Index , a 10-point scale based on 13 measures of social hostilities involving religion , including tensions between religious groups and religion-related terrorism . Although the share of countries in these categories did not change since last year , it was higher than in 2007 , when this study began tracking social hostilities . In addition , several countries joined these top two categories of social hostilities in 2016 . Bangladesh experienced an increase in assaults and killings of members of religious groups by social groups or individuals – including multiple instances where people who had expressed atheist views or were accused of offending Islam on the internet were killed or threatened .
Central and Eastern Europeans in the EU are less willing than Western Europeans in the EU to say they would accept Muslims or Jews as members of their family or as neighbors . In nearly all of the Central and Eastern European countries surveyed , fewer than half of adults say they would be willing to accept Muslims into their family , including 29 % who say this in Romania and 32 % in Bulgaria . Meanwhile , in most of the surveyed Western European countries , more than half of adults say they would accept a Muslim into their family , including 66 % who say this in Finland and 74 % in Spain . The same general pattern holds when Europeans are asked about accepting Jews as family members or neighbors .
Americans are especially likely to say they would benefit from improvements in the services they use to go online . Seven-in-ten cellphone users ( 70 % ) say they would benefit from an unlimited data plan , with 50 % saying they would benefit a lot . And nearly three-quarters of home internet users ( 72 % ) say having more reliable service would help them gather information for decisions , with 48 % saying it would help them a lot .
Among those who prioritize gun rights , 41 % say they would not vote for a candidate with whom they disagreed on gun policy , even if they agreed with the candidate on most other issues . Fewer gun control supporters ( 31 % ) say gun policy is a make-or-break voting issue for them .
The foreign-born population residing in the U.S. reached a record 44.8 million , or 13.7 % of the U.S. population , in 2018 . This immigrant population has more than quadrupled since the 1960s , when the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act took effect . Though growth has begun to slow in recent years , the number of immigrants living in the United States is projected to almost double by 2065 .
While press coverage was more focused on the U.S. attorney scandal and the 15 British sailors being held in Iran this past week , Americans remained more focused on news about the current situation in Iraq . Overall , 26 % of Americans reported following news from Iraq more closely than any other topic , compared with 15 % who tracked the British sailors and 12 % who tracked the U.S. attorney scandal most closely . By comparison , both the British sailors and the U.S. attorney scandal received roughly twice as much press coverage as the situation in Iraq this past week .
To get a glimpse of how America 's racial demographics are changing , take a look at the differences between mixed-race Americans old and young . The racial background of the largest group of multiracial babies ( 36 % ) is black and white , but just 18 % of mixed-race adults claim this background , according to Census Bureau data . A similar pattern emerges for mixed-race people whose background is black and American Indian – among adults , the share is 5 % , while among babies , it is just 1 % . And while almost a quarter of mixed-race babies are white and Asian , this share is just 18 % for adults .
Half or more of Americans have positive views about each of six professional groups asked about in the survey . The public is warmest toward medical doctors : About three-quarters ( 74 % ) say they have a mostly positive view of doctors , 18 % are neutral and just 8 % have a negative view . Majorities also have positive opinions of medical researchers ( 68 % ) , dietitians ( 60 % ) , environmental health specialists ( 60 % ) and environmental researchers ( 57 % ) . About half ( 51 % ) have positive overall views of nutrition researchers . Majorities trust medical doctors and dietitians to care about their patients ' best interests , but trust in other scientists is lower . Respondents were asked whether scientists in each of the six specialties could be trusted to act with competence , to present their recommendations or research findings accurately , and to care about people 's best interests . Americans tend to trust practitioners in medicine and nutrition – who directly interact with patients – more than researchers in these areas . For example , a majority of Americans ( 57 % ) say medical doctors care about patients ' best interests all or most of the time , while far fewer ( 35 % ) say medical researchers always or usually care about the public 's interests . And 60 % say dietitians care about their patients ' best interests all of most of the time , compared with 29 % who say nutrition research scientists care about the public interest with the same frequency . But trust in environmental health specialists – practitioners who offer recommendations to organizations and community groups – is about the same as that for environmental researchers . Most turn a skeptical eye to issues of scientific integrity . Minorities of Americans believe scientists are transparent about potential conflicts of interest with industry all or most of the time . Shares saying this range from 12 % to 19 % , depending on the specific type of work being asked about . Similarly , few Americans ( from 11 % to 18 % ) think scientists admit and take responsibility for their mistakes all or most of the time . And small shares see repercussions for misconduct as commonplace : No more than two-in-ten U.S. adults say scientists in each field of work face serious consequences for misconduct all or most of the time .
A narrow majority ( 56 % ) of unpartnered adults are the head of their household . Some 35 % are living alone and 22 % are living with others in the home ( single parents would fall into this category ) . Nearly three-in-ten ( 28 % ) are living with a parent or grandparent , reflecting the fact that unpartnered adults are disproportionately young . An additional 16 % have some other relationship to the head of the household ( for example , a sibling or roommate ) .
By a two-to-one margin , Republicans and Republican-leaning independents ages 50 and older have an unfavorable view of labor unions ( 64 % unfavorable , 32 % favorable ) . By contrast , a majority of younger Republicans ( 55 % ) express a favorable opinion toward unions ; 43 % view them unfavorably . Nearly three-quarters ( 72 % ) of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents with a college degree say they have a negative view of labor unions , while only 28 % are favorable toward labor . Non-college-educated Republicans hold mixed views of unions : Roughly equal shares say they view labor favorably ( 49 % ) and unfavorably ( 47 % ) .
Republicans are less positive in their views of undocumented immigrants . Still , nearly two-thirds of Republicans ( 64 % ) say undocumented immigrants in the U.S. mostly take jobs citizens do not want , and a narrow majority ( 54 % ) say they are as honest and hardworking as U.S. citizens .
Overall , voters under age 30 are less likely than older voters to say they were contacted by campaigns via printed mail , email or by phone . However , the age differences are more modest in the shares saying they received a text message from a campaign or a visit at home from a campaign representative .
Everyone knows that our genes predispose us to be tall or short , blue-eyed blonds or brown-eyed brunettes , smart or not-so-smart . Now new research finds that , to a surprisingly large degree , our genes also shape our political beliefs and orientation . Individual experiences and other social influences explain much of the remaining variation in political attitudes , reports psychologist Cary Funk , who headed the eight-member team . Their results were just published in the latest issue of Political Psychology . ( For the record , Funk is a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center and carried out this study while an associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University . )
Overall , relatively few voters thought the country had made progress on most issues since 2008 . The economy was the only one of seven about which roughly as many voters said things had gotten better ( 38 % ) as worse ( 43 % ) over this period . Roughly two-in-ten ( 18 % ) thought it has stayed about the same .
Voters are in broad agreement about the importance of ensuring that all people who are legally qualified and want to vote are able to cast their ballots : Nearly all registered voters ( 99 % ) say this is at least somewhat important , including 92 % who say it is very important . Sizable majorities of voters ( 84 % ) also say it is at least somewhat important that people who are not legally qualified to vote are prevented from voting , though fewer say this is very important ( 65 % ) . With the expectation that a far larger share of voters will cast their ballots by mail than in past elections comes the prospect that counting those ballots may take substantially longer than in past years . But about half of registered voters ( 52 % ) say it is very important that Americans know who won the election with a day or two of Election Day , and 82 % say this is at least somewhat important . Virtually all Trump and Biden supporters ( 99 % each ) say it is at least somewhat important that all voters who are qualified and want to vote are able to cast their ballots in the election , and at least nine-in-ten in both coalitions say this is very important .
When it comes to evaluations of how well the current U.S. immigration system is working , Asian Americans are split . 45 % say the system `` works pretty well and requires only minor changes '' while 47 % say the system `` needs to be completely rebuilt '' or `` needs major changes , '' according to a recent survey of Asian-American adults from the Pew Research Center .
More broadly , about half ( 51 % ) of Americans are at least somewhat confident in Trump 's ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements with other countries . Public views of Trump in this domain are more positive than in many other areas . ( However , global trade ranks among the lowest concerns for the public 's policy priorities for 2019 . )
Overall , medians of roughly seven-in-ten across the 14 economically advanced countries surveyed say that global climate change and the spread of infectious diseases are both major threats . Medians of six-in-ten or more cite security concerns – such as terrorism , cyberattacks from other countries and the spread of nuclear weapons – as major threats .
A majority of parents are concerned about the types of experiences their teen might encounter online . Roughly two-thirds of parents of teens ( 65 % ) say they worry at least some about their teen spending too much time in front of screens , including a third who worry a lot about this . Parents express comparable levels of concern about other potentially negative online experiences for their kids : About six-in-ten say they worry a lot or some about their teen losing the ability to have in-person conversations , sharing too much about themselves online , being bullied online or exchanging explicit messages .
Despite the economic troubles facing the news industry , about seven-in-ten Americans ( 71 % ) believe their local news media organizations are doing well financially . This belief persists even though only 14 % of U.S. adults say they personally have paid for local news within the past year , whether through subscriptions , donations or memberships . When asked why they do n't pay for local news , around half of non-payers ( 49 % ) point to the widespread availability of free content .
Another 22 % say they followed news about the heat wave that hit the east and the south very closely ; 4 % say this was the story they followed most closely . News about the heat wave accounted for 4 % of coverage .
Fully 22 % of 2014 voters were 65 and older — a group GOP candidates won by 16-points . By comparison , in 2012 , they made up just 16 % of the electorate .
People from the Northern Triangle – El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras – make up 85 % of migrants apprehended in Mexico so far in fiscal 2019 . Migrants from these countries have historically accounted for the most apprehensions in Mexico , but their share so far in the current fiscal year is the lowest in nearly two decades — 10 percentage points lower than in 2002 , when they made up 95 % of all apprehensions in Mexico .
33 There are substantial differences across racial and ethnic groups when it comes to personal choices about end-of-life medical treatment . Nearly two-thirds of whites ( 65 % ) say they would stop their medical treatment if they had an incurable disease and were suffering a great deal of pain ; by contrast , 61 % of blacks and 55 % of Hispanics say they would tell their doctors to do everything possible to save their lives in these circumstances . According to interviews by Religion News Service , possible reasons for these differences include historic experiences , religious faith and family roles .
While most Americans support legalizing marijuana , there are concerns about public use of the drug , if it were to become legal . Overall , 62 % say that if marijuana were legal it would bother them if people used it in public ; just 33 % say this would not bother them . Like overall views of legalizing marijuana , these views have changed little in recent years .
7 Fewer people express confidence in Trump than in other world leaders . Of the five world leaders asked about in the survey , German Chancellor Angela Merkel gets the most positive rating , with a median of 46 % expressing confidence in her handling of world affairs . Only around three-in-ten express confidence in Trump ( 29 % ) – similar to the share who voice confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping ( 28 % ) . However , the share of people who express no confidence in Trump is higher ( 64 % ) than it is for all of the other world leaders asked about .
As the current chair of the G20 and host of the organization 's upcoming Leaders ' Summit , Russia has asserted itself on the world stage . Yet , in the court of public opinion , Russia gets a mixed verdict . In a global survey by the Pew Research Center , a median of just 36 % among publics in 38 nations express a favorable view of Russia , compared with 39 % who hold an unfavorable view , and 19 % who do not offer an opinion . By contrast , the same survey found the international image of the U.S. to be much more positive , with a median of 63 % expressing a favorable view of America .
Drop-off voters reported less outreach from political candidates and campaigns than did consistent voters . Only about half of drop-off voters ( 51 % ) said they had ever been personally contacted to vote for a candidate , compared with 70 % of consistent voters .
Are smartphones and social media changing social interactions in emerging economies , or are people simply talking to the same people online that they once talked to offline ? A Pew Research Center survey of adults in 11 nations across four global regions finds that , in many key respects , smartphone users – and especially those who use social media – are more regularly exposed to people who have different backgrounds and more connected with friends they do n't see in person . Those with smartphones are also more likely to have accessed new information about health and government services .
When it comes to attitudes about the size and scope of government , people who say the term libertarian describes them well ( and who are able to correctly define the term ) are somewhat more likely than the public overall to say government regulation of business does more harm than good ( 56 % vs. 47 % ) . However , about four-in-ten libertarians say that government regulation of business is necessary to protect the public interest ( 41 % ) .
The balance of leaned partisan affiliation among the public has changed little in recent years : 48 % identify with the Democratic Party or lean Democratic , while 39 % identify as Republicans or lean toward the GOP . Since 1992 , only once – in 2002 – have as many people leaned toward the Republican Party as the Democratic Party ( 43 % each ) . They crossed over two times , one in 2002 as stated and once in 1994 ( 44 % R , 44 % D ) .
Television was far-and-away the most widely-used source of information about the bombing and its aftermath ; 80 % of Americans followed the story on TV . About half ( 49 % ) say they kept up with news and information online or on a mobile device , and 38 % followed the story on the radio . Only 29 % say they kept up with the story in newspapers , about the same number ( 26 % ) tracked the story on social networking sites like Facebook or Twitter .
The economic differences within parties are striking . Republicans and Republican leaners with family incomes of $ 100,000 or more are more likely than any other income group in either party to say the system is fair to most Americans : 60 % of Republicans with incomes of at least $ 100,000 express this view , compared with no more than about four-in-ten Republicans in lower income categories . Among Democrats , the pattern is reversed . Higher-income Democrats and Democratic leaners are the most likely to say the economic system in this country unfairly favors powerful interests : 82 % of Democrats with a household income of $ 100,000 or more say this ; just 17 % say the system is typically fair to `` most Americans . ''
It 's a straightforward question , but the answers yielded some interesting results . One-in-six ( 16 % ) of those who say they `` definitely voted '' in the 2014 midterm election have no record of voting in commercially available national voter files , according to a Pew Research Center analysis .
Young adults are especially likely to use their mobile phones to keep themselves occupied while watching television , as nearly three quarters of all cell owners ages 18 - 24 ( 73 % ) used their cell phone in this manner recently . But while this behavior is especially common among the youngest cell owners , a majority of 25 - 34 year olds and just under half of those in their mid-30s to mid-40s have done this recently .
On a typical day in August , 26 million Americans were using the internet for news or information about politics and the upcoming mid-term elections . That corresponds to 19 % of adult internet users , or 13 % of all Americans over the age of 18 . Comparing August 2006 figures to a similar point in the 2002 mid-term election cycle is particularly revealing . In July 2002 , approximately 11 million Americans , or 13 % of online users , said they got some news or information about politics and the campaign from the internet on the average day . The August 2006 number is nearly two-and-a-half times larger than the mid-summer 2002 figure .
By comparison , the Washington Post/ABC News survey described the situation as follows : The AP reported classified information about U.S. anti-terrorism efforts and prosecutors have obtained AP 's phone records through a court order . Do you think this action by federal prosecutors is or is not justified ? The survey found substantially more saying the actions were justified , by a 52 % -33 % margin . The difference is likely attributable to three differences in the way the surveys described the situation . First , Pew Research referred to the decision to subpoena phone records while the WP/ABC survey said the records were obtained… through a court order , which may make the actions seem more legitimate by highlighting a court 's involvement . Second , what Pew Research described as classified information the WP/ABC poll described as classified information about U.S. anti-terrorism efforts ; past research suggests the public is willing to accept broader government actions in the defense against terrorism . Third , Pew Research mentioned the Justice Department , while WP/ABC mentioned federal prosecutors . It is likely that the DOJ , as a more political institution associated with the administration , is viewed less favorably than are prosecutors . All three of these differences likely contribute to the remarkably different survey results .
More than half of Democrats ( 55 % ) say the Republican Party makes them `` afraid , '' while 49 % of Republicans say the same about the Democratic Party . Among those highly engaged in politics – those who say they vote regularly and either volunteer for or donate to campaigns – fully 70 % of Democrats and 62 % of Republicans say they are afraid of the other party .
The total estimated advertising revenue for the newspaper industry in 2018 was $ 14.3 billion , based on the Center 's analysis of financial statements for publicly traded newspaper companies . This is down 13 % from 2017 . Total estimated circulation revenue was $ 11.0 billion , compared with $ 11.2 billion in 2017 .
Seven-in-ten blacks said blacks were treated less fairly in dealings with the police , versus 37 % of whites who said so ; almost as many blacks ( 68 % ) said blacks were treated less fairly in the courts . About half ( 54 % ) of blacks , versus 16 % of whites , said blacks were treated less fairly at the workplace , a share that 's been rising since the late 1990s . And just over half ( 51 % ) of blacks , compared with 15 % of whites , said their local public schools treated blacks less fairly .
Today , men and women are equally likely to be internet users , a trend that has not wavered throughout the 15 years these surveys have been conducted . However , the earliest Pew Research surveys found that men were more likely than women to be internet users . For instance , a 1995 survey found 9 % of men and 4 % of women had used a `` modem to connect to any computer bulletin boards , information services such as Compuserve or Prodigy . '' By 2000 , when Pew Research began tracking internet use more consistently , 54 % of men were internet users , compared with half of women . This modest gap continued , gradually shrinking until 2008 when a statistically indistinguishable 74 % of men and 73 % of women identified as internet users . Today , 85 % of men and 84 % of women report being internet users .
In general , we found little evidence that cognitive processes of these sorts created mode differences in responses . That may reflect the fact that the questions chosen for this study are drawn from well-tested items designed for telephone surveys , and thus do not reflect the kinds of burdensome items that have previously been shown to create mode effects . It 's also possible that the panelists , having participated in one large telephone survey with Pew Research Center ( the polarization study that was used to recruit the American Trends Panel ) and – for the vast majority – at least one previous panel wave , are savvier survey participants than others and thus are less vulnerable to mode effects than a fresh cross-sectional sample would be . Responses to all but four of the 60 items showed at least some numerical difference by mode , and the median difference across all items was 5 percentage points . The largest difference was 18 points , and there were eight items with differences of at least 10 points . But most of the 24 non-zero differences smaller than 5 percentage points are not statistically significant , and thus could have occurred by chance as a result of sampling error .
People in emerging and developing countries around the world are on balance unhappy with the way their political systems are working . A recent Pew Research Center survey finds that , across 31 emerging and developing nations , a median of 52 % are dissatisfied with their political system , while 44 % are satisfied . Discontent is particularly widespread in the Middle East and Latin America , where about six-in-ten say their system is not working well . The opposite is true , however , in Asia – a median of 60 % are either very or somewhat satisfied with their political system .
Overall , about six-in-ten U.S. adults ( 62 % ) say it 's very or somewhat acceptable for professional athletes to speak out publicly about political issues , while 35 % say this is not too or not at all acceptable . But these views differ by age , race and ethnicity – and especially political affiliation . About three-quarters ( 74 % ) of adults ages 18 to 29 say it is very or somewhat acceptable for professional athletes to speak out publicly about politics . By comparison , 67 % of adults ages 30 to 49 , 55 % of those ages 50 to 64 and half of those 65 and older say this .
Survey experiments also allow researchers to measure how much context matters when asking a question . In an early 2018 survey , researchers asked one group of respondents whether the U.S. Senate should have two seats for every state , regardless of how many people live in the state . A second group of respondents received the same question but were given some additional context – specifically , that the population difference between the nation 's largest and smallest states had grown dramatically over time .
Nonwhite teachers not only were sharply outnumbered by white teachers in America 's classrooms , they also tended to work in different school environments , the NCES data show . For example , 31 % of teachers in city schools were nonwhite , versus just 11 % of teachers in rural schools – a reflection of the broader racial and ethnic makeup of America 's communities . And while nonwhite teachers accounted for 29 % of the total in public charter schools , their share was considerably lower in traditional public schools ( 19 % ) .
Majority says significant changes are needed in structure of government . A 62 % majority of the public says that significant changes are needed in the fundamental design and structure of American government to make it work for current times ; 37 % say the design and structure of government serves the country well , and significant changes are not needed . While views among the public overall have changed little since 2018 , Democrats and Republicans have moved further apart in their opinions . Currently , 79 % of Democrats say significant changes in the structure of government are needed , compared with 41 % of Republicans .
When asked to rate the degree of long-term health risk to the average person from eating four types of foods – each with a different kind of additive introduced at some stage during food production – most Americans report at least `` some '' risk from meat from animals given hormones or antibiotics , or produce grown with pesticides , as well as food and beverages with artificial preservatives or coloring . Public concern is highest for meat from animals given antibiotics or hormones and produce grown with pesticides ( 32 % and 31 % , respectively , consider each to pose `` a great deal '' of health risk to the average person ) followed by food and beverages with artificial preservatives ( 26 % ) or artificial coloring ( 21 % ) .
ISIS is seen as the top threat on both sides of the Atlantic . Eight-in-ten Americans say the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria is a major threat to the U.S. , similar to the median of 76 % across the 10 EU nations polled . Concern about ISIS is particularly high in Spain ( 93 % say it is a major threat ) and France ( 91 % ) . Americans and Europeans may agree ISIS is a top threat , but they differ in how they rank other concerns . For example , while climate change is the second biggest concern in Europe , it is lower on the list in the U.S . Instead , Americans name cyberattacks as the second greatest threat . China 's emergence as a world power rates relatively low in both the U.S. and Europe , although Americans are more concerned than Europeans about Beijing 's growing power .
Between 1990 and 2015 , the total number of people born in Somalia but living outside the country more than doubled , from about 850,000 to 2 million . The share of Somali migrants abroad grew 136 % between 1990 and 2015 , according to United Nations estimates . At the same time , the population of Somalia itself has grown less quickly at 71 % , increasing from 6.3 million in 1990 to 10.8 million in 2015 . ( The global Somali diaspora includes all migrants , both refugees and other migrants . )
President Obama marks the 70th anniversary of the pivotal invasion of Europe at a ceremony in Normandy , France , today to pay tribute to the 16 million Americans who served in World War II . The moment is a particularly special one , given the dwindling ranks of the `` greatest generation '' whose members fought in that costly battle . Just over one million World War II veterans survive today , according to Veterans Administration figures collected by The National WWII Museum .
Most Latino registered voters say they want government to be more involved in solving the nation 's problems , a view that is reflected in their broad support for raising the minimum wage , government involvement in health care and stricter gun laws , according to a national Pew Research Center survey of Latino adults conducted in December . Most Hispanic voters ( 71 % ) say the government should do more to solve problems , while 27 % say government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals . Hispanic Democratic and Republican registered voters have sharply different views on the role of government , though the gap is not as wide as it is among the broader U.S. public . Among Hispanic voters , 82 % who identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party say the government should do more to solve problems , compared with 51 % of those who affiliate with or lean toward the GOP .
The economy was , by far , the top issue for Latino voters . About half ( 49 % ) of Latino voters called it the most important issue facing the country , according to the national exit poll . Health care ( 24 % ) and illegal immigration ( 16 % ) followed . These findings mirror other surveys . For example , our survey has produced similar rankings of the issues over the years . Even though immigration is not the top issue for Latinos , it remains an important one . Two-thirds ( 66 % ) of Latino registered voters say passing new immigration legislation soon is extremely or very important , according to the center 's 2014 National Survey of Latinos .
As the Senate works toward a compromise on immigration reform , the emerging proposal addresses two widely-held public goals . Broad majorities – across party lines – continue to support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants . And large majorities also say this legislation must include increased border security . But the public is divided on an issue that has been among the most contentious in Congress – whether border security must be achieved before the process of legalization can go forward . The national survey by the Pew Research Center and USA TODAY , conducted June 12 - 16 among 1,512 adults , finds that 43 % say that people in the U.S. illegally should be allowed to seek legal status only after effective border control is established , while 49 % say this can occur while border security improvements are being made .
Colleges are continuing to adapt amid new outbreaks in certain COVID-19 hotspots . Against this backdrop , the public has mixed views on whether providing in-person instruction this fall was a good idea . Half of all U.S. adults say colleges and universities that brought students back to campus made the right decision , while 48 % say they did not , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . A separate analysis of Census Bureau data shows that college enrollment among 18- to 24-year-olds dipped only slightly from last year . Views on whether colleges and universities made the right decision in bringing students back to campus are deeply divided along party lines , with Republicans and those who lean to the Republican Party more than twice as likely as Democrats and Democratic leaners to say bringing students back was the right decision . This partisan gap reflects a divide on the response to the coronavirus more broadly . Previous Pew Research Center surveys found that Republicans and Democrats have differed in their views about the severity of the public health crisis , restrictions on businesses and other public activities and mask wearing . In the current poll , 74 % of Republicans say schools that are currently providing in-person instruction made the right decision in bringing students back to campus this fall ; only 29 % of Democrats say the same .
The three networks ' advertiser expenditures for the morning news programs saw a slight increase in 2018 , increasing 3 % to $ 1.13 billion from $ 1.09 billion .
Among whites there is also a gender gap on views of workplace diversity : While 27 % of white women say a growing emphasis on diversity has helped them in their job or career , only 19 % of white men say the same . Similarly , 37 % of white women , compared with 20 % of white men , say women 's increased labor force participation has been beneficial for their own job or career . White women who are college graduates are particularly likely to see more women in the workforce as helpful : Half say this has had a positive impact on their job or career , while 27 % of those without a college degree say the same . When it comes to the growing emphasis on workplace diversity , blacks and Hispanics are about twice as likely as whites to say this has helped their job or career ( 45 % and 43 % respectively vs. 23 % ) . Among whites , these views vary by education : 31 % of white college graduates say this has helped them personally , compared with 17 % of non-college whites .
Public support for conducting all elections by mail has increased sharply since the fall of 2018 – from 34 % then to 52 % today – with most of the change coming among Democrats . Today , 69 % of Democrats strongly or somewhat favor conducting all elections by mail , up from just 40 % two years ago . About a third of all Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 34 % ) , including 44 % of liberal Democrats , strongly favor this proposal . At the same time , Republican support for the measure has ticked up only slightly . About a quarter ( 26 % ) favored conducting all elections by mail in 2018 , compared with roughly a third ( 32 % ) who say they support the proposal today .
What we found – perhaps not surprisingly – is that , in general , feelings of political `` losing '' are associated with higher levels of anger toward government . Among those who say their side loses more than it wins politically , 27 % are angry at the federal government – three times the percentage among those who feel like their side wins more frequently ( 9 % ) .
The share of Americans with a positive view of the federal government fell to 28 % in April , five points lower than the previous year , while public favorability of state government ticked up five points to 57 % . Fully 41 % of Democrats held favorable views of the federal government , compared with only 13 % of Republicans . By contrast , state and local governments are viewed favorably across party lines : 56 % of Democrats and 57 % of Republicans said they had a favorable opinion of their state government . But the partisan makeup of the state government matters : Republicans give more positive ratings to GOP-led state governments , while Democrats rate Democratic-led state governments more highly . Similarly , local governments also received positive ratings , with 67 % of Democrats and 63 % of Republicans seeing them favorably .
Democrats feel more negatively about talking politics with people who have a different opinion of the president than do Republicans . A large majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents – nearly seven-in-ten ( 68 % ) – say they find it to be stressful and frustrating to talk to people with different opinions of Trump . Among Republicans and Republican leaners , fewer ( 52 % ) say they find this to be stressful and frustrating . White Democrats and Democratic leaners are more likely than black and Hispanic Democrats to say it is stressful and frustrating to talk to people with different opinions of Trump . About three quarters of white Democrats ( 74 % ) say it is frustrating , compared with 56 % of black Democrats and 61 % of Hispanic Democrats .
The United States , another principal actor on the world stage , gets mixed reviews in China . Half give the U.S. a favorable rating , while 44 % offer a negative one . But 52 % think the U.S. is trying to prevent China from becoming an equal power ; only 29 % believe the U.S. is willing to accept China 's rise . And the Chinese public names U.S. power and influence as the top international threat facing the country . Just under half ( 45 % ) say the U.S. is a major threat – the highest percentage among the seven potential threats tested on the survey .
While Valentine 's Day is widely celebrated as a time for peak romance – and even marriage proposals – marriage is n't the only way to achieve happiness and contentment for many Americans . Fewer than one-in-five U.S. adults say being married is essential for a man or a woman to live a fulfilling life , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in summer 2019 . Similar shares of adults say that marriage is essential for women ( 17 % ) and men ( 16 % ) to live fulfilling lives . A much larger share of Americans ( 54 % ) say being married is important but not essential for men and women to live fulfilling lives . And about three-in-ten say marriage is not important in this respect .
A clear majority of those surveyed in a March Pew Research survey disapprove ( 56 % ) of the provision in the 2010 Affordable Care Act that requires most individuals to have health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty . About four-in-ten ( 41 % ) approve of the mandate . The constitutionality of the requirement is a key component of the Supreme Court case expected to be decided by the end of June . The partisan divides remain stark over the health care law in general . In the April survey , 87 % of Republicans say they disapprove and 9 % approve of the law . Among Democrats , 74 % approve and 17 % disapprove . About half of independents ( 52 % ) disapprove , while 36 % approve . And the disparity is nearly as large in responses to questions about the health care mandate . About eight-in-ten Republicans ( 83 % ) disapprove of the mandate , while two-thirds of Democrats ( 66 % ) approve of it . A majority of independents opposes the mandate ( 60 % vs. 36 % ) .
The legacy of the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center and subsequent terrorist incidents at home and abroad still cast a long shadow over many Americans . The survey , conducted Oct. 30-Nov. 6 , found that 75 % of Americans said that extremist groups like al Qaeda pose a major threat to the U.S. That level of concern was virtually unchanged since 2009 .
Before Jones ' win in December , only 13 states had split Senate delegations in the current Congress . That was the fewest in the past five decades , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Senate membership data going back to the 90th Congress ( 1967 - 68 ) . Now , with 14 split delegations , the current Senate is tied with several other Congresses for second-fewest in the past 50 years – there were 14 during most of the 107th Congress and all of the 108th and 109th Congresses , spanning 2001 through early 2007 . But politically divided delegations became more common in the 1960s and ' 70s as decades-old patterns of state-level party dominance began to break down . By the 96th Congress of 1979 - 80 , more than half the states ( 27 ) had split delegations , and from 1969 through 1994 more than 20 states sent split delegations to the Senate . Since then , despite some ups and downs , the trend has been toward more single-party delegations . As of now , 19 states have two Republican senators and 17 have two Democrats .
Significant shares of Facebook users have taken steps in the past year to reframe their relationship with the social media platform . Just over half of Facebook users ages 18 and older ( 54 % ) say they have adjusted their privacy settings in the past 12 months , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . Around four-in-ten ( 42 % ) say they have taken a break from checking the platform for a period of several weeks or more , while around a quarter ( 26 % ) say they have deleted the Facebook app from their cellphone . All told , some 74 % of Facebook users say they have taken at least one of these three actions in the past year .
Half of this group thinks that their vote does n't really affect how the government runs things , notably higher than the 36 % of those who learned about the election from at least one type of source .
African Americans are more religious than whites and Latinos by many measures of religious commitment . For instance , three-quarters of black Americans say religion is very important in their lives , compared with smaller shares of whites ( 49 % ) and Hispanics ( 59 % ) ; African Americans also are more likely to attend services at least once a week and to pray regularly . Black Americans ( 83 % ) are more likely to say they believe in God with absolute certainty than whites ( 61 % ) and Latinos ( 59 % ) .
More than 22.4 million people applied in 2017 to a U.S. visa program that provides 50,000 green cards , or lawful permanent residence , each year through a lottery system , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. State Department data . The number of applicants nearly matched the record 23 million applicants received in 2016 and came as the Trump administration and some members of Congress have sought to eliminate the program – the only one of its kind globally . Since 2005 , more than 200 million people from countries around the world have applied for the program , known as the U.S. diversity lottery , which seeks to diversify the nation 's immigrant population by granting visas to immigrants from nations that are underrepresented among recently arrived immigrants .
Many voters – including many of her supporters – doubt Clinton will change Washington much . Overall , about half ( 53 % ) of voters in our June survey say Clinton wo n't change the way things work in Washington much . Those who think she will change Washington are divided on whether it will be for the better ( 20 % ) or the worse ( 25 % ) . Even voters who say they will support Clinton in a matchup against Trump this fall say she 's unlikely to bring much change to the way things work in Washington . Well over half ( 58 % ) say this , while another 38 % say she will bring positive change . Trump 's supporters are roughly evenly divided between those who say she would make things worse ( 52 % ) and those who say things would n't change much under a Clinton administration ( 46 % ) .
Pessimism and disaffection are widespread among Italians ahead of the country 's general election on Sunday . In a Pew Research Center survey conducted last fall , 82 % of Italians said they distrust parliament and an equal share said the national economic situation is bad . About three-quarters ( 77 % ) said politicians do n't care what people like them think , including 59 % who felt that way strongly .
Slightly more than a quarter ( 27 % ) say they heard a lot last week about CBS correspondent Lara Logan being attacked while covering events in Egypt . Another 42 % say they heard a little about this , while 31 % say they heard nothing at all . Women were more likely than men to say they heard a lot about this story ( 31 % vs. 22 % ) . About as many ( 26 % ) say they heard a lot about protests in Wisconsin over bargaining rights for government employee unions . A third ( 34 % ) say they heard a little about this , while 40 % say they heard nothing at all .
Majorities in Lebanon , Venezuela , South Africa , Colombia and India said they frequently or occasionally interact with people who have different religious beliefs than they do . On the other hand , in Mexico , Jordan , Vietnam and Tunisia , more than half of adults said these interfaith connections happened only rarely or never . Filipinos and Kenyans were split about the frequency of their exchanges with people of other religions .
When financial stress becomes too much to bear , bankruptcy becomes an option . Individual ( non-business ) bankruptcy filings surged during the Great Recession — largely due to sharp increases in Chapter 7 ( liquidation ) filings . Though individual bankruptcy filings have fallen since 2010 , they remain well above pre-recession levels .
Both McConnell and Schumer draw positive ratings from members of their own parties . Still , fewer than half of Republican and Republican-leaning independent voters ( 46 % ) say they have warm feelings toward McConnell , while about a quarter rate him coldly ( 26 % ) and 28 % offer a neutral score of 50 on the thermometer . Schumer 's ratings among Democrats and Democratic leaners are similar : 46 % warm , 26 % cold , 27 % neutral . The ratings for both Senate leaders are more positive among the most ideological members of their parties . A 56 % majority of conservative Republican voters view McConnell warmly , compared with just 20 % of moderate and liberal Republicans . Schumer is much more popular among liberal Democrats ( 60 % of whom give him a warm rating ) than among his party 's conservative and moderate voters ( 33 % ) . Most striking of all may be the negative ratings that both Senate leaders – and especially McConnell – receive from voters in the opposing party , particularly those who are strongly ideological . McConnell gets warm ratings from just 2 % of Democratic voters , while 77 % say they have very cold feelings toward him . And among liberal Democrats , 89 % feel very coldly toward him . Schumer 's ratings among Republicans are less intensely negative . Still , a large majority of Republicans ( 69 % ) feel very coldly toward Schumer , including 78 % of conservative Republicans .
There are also some patterns by age . Even though young adults tend to follow the news less closely than older adults , they are just as likely to both see and follow up on news alerts on their phones : 54 % of 18- to 29-year-old smartphone owners get news alerts , as do 56 % of those ages 30 - 49 and 50 - 64 and 49 % of those ages 65 and older ( they also often get news alerts at roughly similar rates ) . And just under half of all age groups tend to click through for more information .
A third of the social media users who are single and looking and who say they see others ' posts about their love life say that seeing these posts makes them feel worse . This compares with 62 % who report that such posts by others do not make much of a difference in how they feel about their own dating life . Just 4 % say it makes them feel better .
Younger Venezuelans and those with higher levels of education are slightly less likely to trust the government . Partisan differences are particularly stark . Those who identified as supporters of Maduro 's United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) when the poll was conducted are much more likely to trust the government than those who support other parties or have no partisan affiliation ; 71 % of PSUV backers trust the national government , compared with just 20 % of other people .
The December 2017 survey asked people if they were active in 10 specific types of community groups and organizations : church groups , hobby groups , charitable or volunteer organizations , professional associations , community groups , book clubs , parent groups or youth organizations , social clubs , performing arts groups and veterans ' groups . It also gave respondents the chance to say they are involved in some `` other '' type of group or organization ( beyond the ones listed above ) .
About half ( 52 % ) of American adults lived in middle-class households in 2016 . This is virtually unchanged from the 51 % who were middle class in 2011 . But while the size of the nation 's middle class remained relatively stable , financial gains for middle-income Americans during this period were modest compared with those of higher-income households , causing the income disparity between the groups to grow . The recent stability in the share of adults living in middle-income households marks a shift from a decades-long downward trend . From 1971 to 2011 , the share of adults in the middle class fell by 10 percentage points . But that shift was not all down the economic ladder . Indeed , the increase in the share of adults who are upper income was greater than the increase in the share who are lower income over that period , a sign of economic progress overall .
Ten years ago today , a little website called thefacebook.com was launched . Initially restricted to Harvard undergraduates , the site had 1 million users by the end of 2004 . Today , Facebook ( `` the '' was dropped in 2005 ) has more than 1.2 billion `` monthly active users '' around the world . As of December , the company says 757 million people used the social-networking service on any given day . These days , Facebook 's strongest growth is coming from overseas . The monthly user base ( defined as those who accessed the site at least once in the previous 30 days ) grew just 4.1 % in the U.S. and Canada last year , according to the company 's annual 10-K report . In Europe , it grew by 8 % ; in Asia , 23.5 % ( including Australia and New Zealand ) ; and in the rest of the world , it grew by 23.7 % . American and Canadian users , in fact , now make up less than a sixth of Facebook 's total user base .
When asked if they received too many , not enough or just about the right amount of messages on dating sites or apps , 43 % of Americans who online dated in the past five years say they did not receive enough messages , while 17 % say they received too many messages . Another 40 % think the amount of messages they received was just about right . There are substantial gender differences in the amount of attention online daters say they received on dating sites or apps . Men who have online dated in the past five years are far more likely than women to feel as if they did not get enough messages ( 57 % vs. 24 % ) . On the other hand , women who have online dated in this time period are five times as likely as men to think they were sent too many messages ( 30 % vs. 6 % ) .
Americans with a bachelor 's or postgraduate degree ( both 81 % ) are more likely than adults who attended some college ( 73 % ) or who have a high school diploma or less ( 63 % ) to have positive overall opinions of medical doctors . A similar education pattern exists for opinions of medical researchers . White adults ( 75 % ) are more likely than black adults ( 61 % ) to have a positive view of medical doctors . Black Americans also stand out for their lower ratings of medical research scientists : About half ( 53 % ) have a positive view , compared with majorities of white ( 68 % ) and Hispanic ( 67 % ) adults .1
Evangelicals cite other reasons for supporting him beyond opposition to Clinton . Roughly one-third of evangelical Trump supporters also pointed to his issue positions as the main reason they support him , and about one-quarter ( 26 % ) mentioned his status as a political outsider who will bring change to the political system as a reason for backing him . One-in-five said they support him because of his personality and `` tell-it-like-it-is '' style .
The public overwhelmingly sees the issue of sexual assault and harassment as very important for the country . About three-quarters of the public ( 74 % ) say it is `` very important '' for the country . Among five current issues tested , only proposed changes to the federal tax system rank as important as sexual assault and harassment in the public 's view . Democrats and Democratic leaners are 20 percentage points more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to view the issue of sexual assault and harassment as very important . Nevertheless , nearly nine-in-ten Republicans ( 87 % ) say it is at least somewhat important . Very few Republicans or Democrats regard this issue as not important . More women than men say the issue of sexual assault and harassment is very important . And adults younger than 30 are more likely to view this issue as very important than are people 50 and older .
Some of these positive views , though , are contingent on the respondent 's religious affiliation . Take India as an example . While Muslims were seen less favorably than Hindus in the country as a whole , this may in part reflect the fact that Muslims make up only 14 % of the Indian population . Among Muslim respondents , 98 % had a favorable view of Muslims , whereas among Hindus , favorability was much lower ( 65 % ) . More than nine-in-ten across both religious groups gave favorable views of Hindus , regardless of how they identified religiously .
While online daters generally say their overall experience was positive , they also point out some of the downsides of online dating . By a wide margin , Americans who have used a dating site or app in the past year say their recent experience left them feeling more frustrated ( 45 % ) than hopeful ( 28 % ) . Other sentiments are more evenly balanced between positive and negative feelings . Some 35 % of current or recent users say that in the past year online dating has made them feel more pessimistic , while 29 % say these platforms left them feeling more optimistic . Similarly , 32 % say online dating sites or apps made them feel more confident , whereas 25 % say it left them feeling more insecure .
Among all Christian religious traditions in the U.S. , Mormons are among the most highly involved in their congregations ( 67 % ) , according to an analysis based on three measures of congregational involvement : membership in a congregation , frequency of attendance at worship services and frequency of attendance at small group religious activities . Jehovah 's Witnesses have comparable levels of highly involved members ( 64 % ) , while evangelical Protestants ( 43 % ) , members of historically black Protestant denominations ( 41 % ) and those in other Christian groups have lower average levels of congregational involvement . In addition , our Religious Landscape Study found that Mormons are among the groups most likely to believe the Bible is the word of God ( 91 % ) , pray daily ( 85 % ) , say religion is very important in their lives ( 84 % ) and read scripture regularly ( 77 % ) .
For the most part , Americans ' conversations about the election have not led to arguments , though 38 % of the public says they have had an argument about the election or its outcome . Still , just 9 % characterize the arguments as `` major . '' In July , a nearly identical share of registered voters ( 37 % ) said they had argued about the election .
With the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 10 , the presidential campaign was the public 's and the media 's top story last week . Three-in-ten ( 31 % ) say this was the news they followed most closely ; 20 % say their top story was the economy . Campaign news dominated coverage , accounting for 41 % of the newshole , according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism ( PEJ ) .
A Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2018 , before any of the current contenders announced their candidacy , found that more than four-in-ten Americans ( 45 % ) said they personally hoped a woman would be elected president in their lifetime . About half of all women ( 51 % ) said they personally hoped this would happen , compared with 38 % of men .
Trump 's key foreign policies are unpopular . When asked in the spring and summer of 2019 about six of Trump 's key foreign policies , people around the world largely expressed disapproval . They are especially critical of his tariff policy and the withdrawal from climate change agreements such as the Paris Agreement . Trump 's immigration policies , including his well-known plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border , are also unpopular , with a few exceptions in Central and Eastern Europe and Israel . People also see Trump 's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear weapons agreement negatively but are more positive about his negotiations with Kim Jong Un over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program . ( The survey was conducted prior to the Jan. 3 , 2020 , U.S. missile strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani . ) 9 Trump 's restrictions on immigration are more popular among those who support right-wing populist parties in Europe . When asked whether they approve of Trump 's policy to allow fewer immigrants in the U.S. , people who support National Rally in France , Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) in Germany and Sweden Democrats in Sweden are at least 40 percentage points more likely than nonsupporters to express approval . This stark difference between populist supporters and non-populist supporters appears in many European countries and extends to opinions about Trump himself , as well as to his policy of building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico .
Some 55 % of working Ph.D. scientists belonging to the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) who we surveyed in 2014 said this was generally a good time for their scientific specialty , while 44 % said it was a bad time . And while nearly half ( 47 % ) said it was a good or very good time to begin a career in their field , 53 % said it was a bad time to start out in their field .
While a 55 % majority of Trump supporters say the party would unite behind him , they are somewhat more skeptical about this than McCain and Romney supporters were during the 2008 and 2012 primaries , respectively . In 2008 , 64 % of McCain supporters said the party would unite behind him , while 75 % of Romney supporters said this in 2012 . Cruz and Kasich supporters are more skeptical of Trump 's ability to unite the party than were supporters of prior candidates who did not become the GOP 's eventual nominee in past elections . A slim majority of Republican voters who supported candidates Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul in February 2008 said they believed the party would solidly unite behind John McCain if he were to become the nominee ( as he later did ) . And an even wider majority ( 62 % ) of supporters of Newt Gingrich , Ron Paul and Rick Santorum said they believed the party would solidly unite behind Mitt Romney , the eventual GOP nominee , in April 2012 .
Views of the economy are closely associated with party affiliation and where people stand on the political spectrum , less so the EU referendum vote . The British public was roughly divided on their views of the economy , with 49 % saying that the economic situation is bad in the UK and 50 % saying that it is good . Positive views were concentrated among Conservative supporters and those on the political right , with a slimmer majority among `` leave '' voters . Negative views predominated among those who voted `` remain '' ( 60 % ) , supporters of Labour ( 60 % ) and people on the political left ( 69 % ) .
A related trend is the sharp rise in news coverage of the stock market , which reflects this growing public interest in such news . An analysis of Wall Street coverage since 1990 by selected news organizations ( CBS Evening News , Newsweek and The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer ) shows that through 1996 , these outlets covered an average of about 100 stories on the stock market each year ( aside from brief market updates ) . The number rose dramatically to well over 200 per year beginning in 1997 . Although the market has always generated news when it boomed or crashed ( such as in 1987 or 1998 ) , the high level of coverage since 1997 has persisted . The trend is evident in both print and broadcast media .
Instead , it is more common to see these legislators tweeting on a weekly – or even monthly – basis . Among lawmakers who posted at least one tweet during this six-month period , 86 % of those in the U.S. posted at least one tweet per week , but that share falls to just 27 % for those in New Zealand . In fact , nearly one-third of such legislators in New Zealand posted less than one tweet per month .
Race is a factor in their political attitudes . Silents are the whitest of the generations and are the least accepting of the new face of America . Compared with younger generations , relatively few Silents see racial intermarriage and the growing population of immigrants as changes for the better .
Mormons are the most heavily Republican-leaning religious group in the U.S. , while a pair of major historically black Protestant denominations – the African Methodist Episcopal ( AME ) Church and the National Baptist Convention – are two of the most reliably Democratic groups , according to our February blog post based on data from Pew Research Center 's 2014 Religious Landscape Study .
The most socially acceptable way to break up with someone is by having an in-person conversation , and these conversations are the most common way that breakups occur in a `` real-world '' setting . While most teens rate an in-person talk as the most acceptable way to break up with someone , some 62 % of teens with relationship experience have broken up with someone in person , and 47 % have been broken up with through an in-person discussion .
Regarding general internet usage , rural adult Americans have consistently lagged their urban and suburban counterparts by a margin that varies between about 11 and 15 percentage points . However , according to our September and December 2005 combined data , 62 % of adult rural Americans were internet users compared with 70 % of non-rural Americans . This is the narrowest end-of-year difference in overall internet penetration between rural and non-rural Americans that we have recorded .
Black adults are particularly likely to say slavery continues to have an impact : More than eight-in-ten say this is the case , including 59 % who say the legacy of slavery affects the situation of black people a great deal . By comparison , 26 % of whites , 29 % of Hispanics and 33 % of Asians say slavery affects the position of black people in American society today a great deal , though majorities of each group say it does so at least a fair amount .
According to the May report , 41 % of people who prioritize gun rights said they would n't vote for a candidate with whom they disagreed on gun policy , even if they agreed with the candidate on most other issues . Only 31 % of gun-control supporters said gun policy was a make-or-break voting issue for them .
It is important to keep in mind that public beliefs about science and scientists are n't necessarily indicators of trust , per se . One example involves public support for the products of scientific and technological innovation . A Pew Research Center survey found that about two-thirds of people see the effects of science on society as mostly positive , which is consistent with some 35 years of data from the General Social Survey . Looking at the components of trust in science across these three scientific areas— vaccines , climate change , and GM food— two patterns stand out . First , public trust in scientists is stronger , by comparison , than it is for several other groups in society . For example , many more people report trust in information from medical scientists , climate scientists , and GM food scientists than information from industry leaders , the news media , and elected officials . On the other hand , no more than about half of people hold strongly trusting views of scientists in any of these domains . For example , only 47 % of people say that medical scientists understand the health effects of the measles , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine `` very well . '' Some 43 % hold soft positive views of medical understanding about the MMR vaccine , saying medical scientists understand this issue `` fairly well . '' Public confidence in scientists is relatively strong compared with trust in other institutional groups . Only the military earns more confidence from the public . Still , people seem guarded . No more than a third of people report a `` great deal '' of confidence in any of these groups to act in the public interest . Overall , more people express positive than negative confidence in scientists , but a 55 % majority express only a soft confidence in scientists to act in the public interest . Public trust in scientists as sources of information is generally higher than it is for any of several other groups in society . For example , far more people trust medical scientists to provide full and accurate information about the health effects of childhood vaccines than they trust information from pharmaceutical industry leaders , the news media , or elected officials . The same pattern occurs for public trust in information from climate scientists and from GM food scientists .
Partisan divisions over gun policy proposals may reflect contrasting views among Republicans and Democrats on gun violence in the country today and on the impact of access to guns on crime and mass shootings . Though clear majorities of both Republicans ( 74 % ) and Democrats ( 92 % ) consider gun violence to be at least a moderately big problem in the U.S. , a much greater share of Democrats ( 65 % ) than Republicans ( 32 % ) say gun violence is a `` very big '' problem in the country .
People hold mixed assessments about the influences operating on science research . About half of people ( 52 % ) say that the best available scientific evidence influences medical research on childhood vaccines `` most of the time , '' while some 36 % say this occurs `` some of the time '' and another 9 % say this seldom or never happens . There is even less public trust in research connected with climate change and GM foods ; roughly three in 10 people say the best available scientific evidence influences climate research or GM food research `` most of the time . ''
Nearly six months before the congressional midterm elections in November , just 19 % of Americans say they are following news about the candidates and campaign in their state or district very closely , while 32 % say they are following them fairly closely . About half of Americans ( 49 % ) say they are following election news not too closely or not at all closely . There are differences in attentiveness by race , education and ideology . Blacks are significantly more likely than either whites or Hispanics to say they have been following campaign news very closely ( 30 % of blacks compared with 18 % of whites and 13 % of Hispanics ) . Only about a third of those younger than 30 ( 32 % ) are tracking news about the congressional elections even fairly closely , with just 6 % following this news very closely . Nearly half of those ages 30 to 49 ( 47 % ) are following news about the midterms very or fairly closely , as are a majority of those 50 and older ( 61 % ) .
Young adults are more likely to use their cellphones for a variety of tasks and to say it 's OK to do so in social situations . Some 52 % of cellphone owners ages 18 to 29 say they frequently use their phone to look up information about where they are going while out in public , compared with 9 % of cell users ages 65 and older . Similarly , 49 % of younger cell users say they frequently use their phone to coordinate getting together with others while they are out and about , compared with just 12 % of seniors .
The other core Republican group – Main Street Republicans – are more negative about Wall Street 's impact on the economy ; just 36 % say it helps more than it hurts , while 45 % say the opposite . Main Street Republicans are socially and fiscally conservative , but are much more skeptical of business than are Staunch Conservatives .
The second most heavily covered news story of the week involved Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and the controversy surrounding his recent statements to Congress . The national news media devoted 6 % of its overall coverage to this story . Public interest in this story remains relatively low , as the focus has expanded from Gonzales 's involvement in the firing of eight U.S. attorneys to questions about whether he misled Congress on important national security issues . This past week 15 % of the public followed the Gonzales story very closely , unchanged from last month and down slightly from late-March and early-April when 22 % were following the story very closely . Republicans and Democrats are following this story in nearly equal proportions — a change from earlier months when Democrats were tracking the story much more closely than Republicans . The gruesome murders of a mother and her two daughters in Cheshire , Connecticut drew a relatively large news audience last week . Although only 12 % said they followed the story very closely , 9 % listed this as the story they followed most closely , making it the number three story in terms of news interest . Overall , the national news media devoted 2 % of its coverage to this story .
Germans in both areas say living standards in the former East have not yet caught up with those in the former West . Around three-quarters of people in the former East Germany ( 74 % ) and around two-thirds of those in the former West ( 66 % ) say the East still has not achieved the same living standards as the West , according to the Center 's recent survey , which was conducted among representative samples of adults in both areas as part of a larger study of Europe .
For instance , while a majority of Israeli Muslims ( 68 % ) say religion is very important in their lives , this share is substantially lower than the 89 % who say the same in Morocco or the 85 % in the nearby Palestinian territories and Jordan . Lebanon is the only country polled in the region where a slim majority of Muslims say religion is very important in their personal lives ( 59 % ) .
Second , people believe that technologies that would bring more dramatic or extreme changes to human abilities are less acceptable than technologies that cause less dramatic or temporary changes . For example , 47 % of Americans consider the use of synthetic blood substitutes to improve physical abilities an `` appropriate use of technology '' if the resulting change to people 's speed , strength and stamina would be `` equal to their own peak abilities . '' But if the same enhancement results in physical abilities `` far above that of any human known to date , '' far fewer ( 28 % ) say it would be an appropriate use of technology . The same pattern occurs as Americans consider the potential use of gene editing and devices implanted in the brain to augment human abilities .
Even before a driverless Uber vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona this week , a slight majority of Americans said they were at least somewhat worried about the development of autonomous cars and hesitant about riding in one if given the chance . Slightly more than half of U.S. adults ( 54 % ) said in a Pew Research Center survey conducted in May 2017 that they were somewhat or very worried about the development of driverless vehicles , while 40 % said they were at least somewhat enthusiastic about it . A majority of U.S. adults ( 56 % ) also said they would not personally want to ride in a driverless car if they had the opportunity , compared with 44 % who would .
There are also sizable differences in views about this issue by age , with younger adults ages 18 to 29 especially likely ( 66 % ) to see government regulations as necessary . Seniors 65 and older , however , think the private marketplace is the most effective way to increase reliance on renewable energy sources by a 50 % -41 % margin . Differences by age hold even when accounting for the tendency of older adults to identify with the GOP .
Nearly a quarter ( 23 % ) of those who say gun rights should be the priority have contributed money to an organization that takes a position on gun policy , compared with just 5 % of those who prioritize gun control . People who favor gun rights are also about twice as likely as gun control supporters to have contacted a public official about gun policy ( 15 % vs. 8 % ) . By contrast , comparable percentages of gun rights supporters ( 19 % ) and those who prioritize gun control ( 15 % ) say they have expressed their opinion about gun policy on social networks . And about one-in-ten in each group says they have signed a petition on gun policy ( 12 % of gun rights supporters , 10 % of gun control supporters ) . Read more
Some 45 % of the public believes solar geoengineering would bring net harm to the environment , however . Three-in-ten U.S. adults think these techniques would bring net benefits to the environment and 22 % say they would have little effect on the environment .
The five countries with the largest active-duty U.S. military presence in 2016 were Japan ( 38,818 ) , Germany ( 34,602 ) , South Korea ( 24,189 ) , Italy ( 12,088 ) and Afghanistan ( 9,023 ) . Of the top five countries , Afghanistan is the only one in open conflict , an issue that President Donald Trump addressed in a speech Monday .
Because Spanish is the most common language spoken by Americans except for English , the pope will find a large share of his parishioners able to understand his message . A majority of all Hispanic adults identify as Catholic and a large majority of Hispanic Catholics speak Spanish fluently , according to our 2013 National Survey of Latinos . Eight-in-ten Hispanic Catholics use mostly Spanish or are bilingual . In fact , they are more likely to be Spanish speakers than non-Catholic Hispanics ( 68 % ) .
In addition , Democrats are more likely to name Germany as a top foreign policy partner for the U.S . Among Democrats , 21 % believe Germany is one of the two most important partners for the U.S. , putting it in the third spot overall behind Great Britain ( 32 % ) and China ( 26 % ) . Among Republicans , Germany is tied for the seventh spot , alongside Russia , with just 5 % of Republicans citing it as a top partner .
A 2013 poll we conducted of 40 countries showed that , globally , Indians are among the most likely to say that Islamic extremist groups pose a major threat to their country . Two-in-three Indians said that Islamic extremist groups are a major security concern . Worries about Islamic extremist groups were about the same in Senegal , where 67 % said Islamic extremist groups are a major threat . Only in Italy ( 74 % ) , France ( 71 % ) and Lebanon ( 70 % ) did a slightly higher proportion of adults share the view that Islamic extremist groups are a serious national threat .
Nearly two-in-ten each ( 18 % ) say they very closely followed news about Obama releasing his long-form birth certificate or news about continuing unrest in the Middle East . About one-in-ten say the birth certificate news ( 8 % ) or Middle East developments ( 8 % ) was their top story of the week . News out of the Middle East accounted for 6 % coverage , most focusing on the situation in Syria , according to PEJ .
Young men make up a disproportionately large share of people who play video games in the United States . But about four-in-ten women and roughly a quarter of Americans ages 65 and older also say they play video games at least sometimes , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March and April . As with other types of technology , video games are most popular among young adults . Six-in-ten Americans ages 18 to 29 and 53 % of those ages 30 to 49 say they play video games often or sometimes , compared with smaller shares in older age groups . The survey counts video games played on a computer , TV , game console or portable device , such as a mobile phone .
About half of the public ( 48 % ) says life for future generations of Americans will be worse than life today , while a quarter ( 25 % ) say it will be better and a similar share ( 26 % ) say it will be about the same . Within nearly all major demographic and political groups , more say life will be worse for future generations than say it will be better . Younger adults are somewhat more likely than older adults to say life will be better for future generations . A third of those ages 18 to 29 say this , compared with about a quarter of those ages 30 to 49 ( 24 % ) and 50 to 64 ( 23 % ) and 20 % of adults 65 and older . A third of Black Americans ( 33 % ) say life will be better for future generations , while a smaller share of white Americans ( 22 % ) say this . About a quarter of Hispanic Americans ( 26 % ) say life will be better for future generations .
Overall , views of extremist groups are negative across the Muslim publics surveyed . A median of about a third or fewer have a positive view of al Qaeda , the Taliban , Hamas , or Hezbollah . And in no country polled do any of these organizations receive majority Muslim support . Al Qaeda , which is responsible for some of the most well-known and devastating terrorist attacks in the last 15 years , receives the most negative ratings among the extremist groups included in the survey . A median of 57 % across the 11 Muslim publics surveyed hold an unfavorable view of the group . This includes strong majorities of Muslims in Lebanon ( 96 % ) , Jordan ( 81 % ) , Turkey ( 73 % ) , and Egypt ( 69 % ) . More than half of Muslims in Nigeria , Senegal , Tunisia , Indonesia , and the Palestinian territories also view al Qaeda negatively . In Pakistan and Malaysia , Muslim views of al Qaeda are on balance unfavorable , but many offer no opinion .
Among women who did not live with their spouse before getting married for the first time , 57 % can expect to still be married after 20 years . For women who lived with their spouse before marriage , the probability of being married for at least 20 years is somewhat lower – 46 % . Whether the couple was engaged when they lived together did n't make a difference in women 's chances of long-lasting marriages .
One factor in people 's intention to be vaccinated is their assessment of their own need for the vaccine . About half of Americans who see themselves as being at little or no risk of getting a case of COVID-19 that would require hospitalization say they would not get vaccinated ( 52 % ) .
The ruling has been one of the most anticipated of the Court 's term . A new Pew Research Center survey found that 35 % of the public said they were `` very interested '' in how the Court would rule — about as many as expressed that level of interest in two pending same-sex marriage cases and in Monday 's affirmative-action decision .
The more serious forms of harassment are less frequent : 10 % of men and 6 % of women said they had been physically threatened on online platforms and similar shares said they had been harassed for a sustained period of time , stalked or sexually harassed .
Iran received some of the lowest marks among the countries asked about in this year 's survey , which also included the U.S. and China . A 14-country median of 71 % said they disliked Iran , making critical views of it more common than unfavorable opinions of the U.S. and about as common as negative assessments of China . In five of the 14 nations surveyed , Iran is the least popular country among those asked about , and in Germany it is tied with China for last place .
The predominant view among emerging and developing countries is that their economies will improve over the next 12 months . But a plurality in advanced economies expects economic conditions to remain about the same . Relatively few around the world foresee their economies worsening .
The 9/11 attacks imprinted themselves on Americans ' psyches in a way few other events in living memory have . In an August 2011 Pew Research survey , 97 % of Americans who were at least eight years old when the attacks happened said they remembered exactly where they were or what they were doing when they heard the news . The only event with that kind of recall was President Kennedy 's assassination in 1963 ( 95 % ) . Other notable events , from the 1969 moon landing to Osama bin Laden 's killing , ranked well behind . In a December 2009 poll , 53 % of Americans picked the 9/11 attacks as the most important event of the previous decade .
The new survey also asked Americans to consider the overall risks and benefits of access to experimental treatments before the completion of clinical trials . ( This process is already happening for some patients with the coronavirus . ) Around six-in-ten Americans ( 59 % ) say the benefits of allowing more people to access experimental drugs outweigh the risks , while 40 % say the risks outweigh the benefits . Republicans are more likely to say the benefits outweigh the risks ( 69 % vs. 29 % ) , but Democrats are about evenly divided ( 50 % vs. 48 % ) . Black adults are more likely than white and Hispanic adults to say the risks of experimental treatments outweigh the benefits : A 57 % majority of black adults say this .
There is less agreement in public views about other aspects of campaign coverage . Majorities say they want more coverage of the candidates ' debates ( 57 % ) , their sources of campaign money ( 55 % ) , their personal backgrounds ( 55 % ) , and the candidates who are not frontrunners ( 55 % ) . However , a third or more says that they would like to see less coverage of each of these aspects of the presidential campaign . The public is decidedly unenthusiastic about one area of campaign coverage : just 42 % say they would like to see more coverage of which candidate is leading in the polls , while 45 % wants to see less coverage . That result , like others relating to campaign coverage , has changed very little since May .
Similarly , the bulk of political campaign contributions happen offline , even as online donations have grown more prominent in recent years . Some 23 % of political donors made only online contributions in 2012 , yet the substantial majority of political donors ( 60 % ) make contributions only via offline methods ( that is , in person , over the telephone , or via regular mail ) .
The age differences in positive support for Biden are particularly stark among Black voters who support him . Among Black voters ages 50 and older , 68 % say their vote is more for Biden ; among those younger than 50 , just 39 % say the same .
Adults who live in someone else 's household typically live with a relative . Today , 14 % of adults living in someone else 's household are a parent of the household head , up from 7 % in 1995 . Some 47 % of extra adults today are adult children living in their mom and/or dad 's home , down from 52 % in 1995 . Other examples of extra adults are a sibling living in the home of a brother or sister , or a roommate .
As the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise in the U.S. , a majority of Americans say that the best ways to prevent the spread of the disease are pretty well understood . And even as some research studies have suggested conflicting advice about efforts to confront COVID-19 , most Americans consider this to be an understandable part of the research process , rather than a sign that research studies ca n't be trusted . Seven-in-ten Americans say the core strategies for containing the coronavirus are well understood , even though research studies have yielded conflicting advice . A far smaller share ( 28 % ) says it 's difficult to know how best to prevent the spread of COVID-19 , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted April 29-May 5 , 2020 . As scientific understanding of the coronavirus continues to evolve , most Americans ( 78 % ) say it makes sense that studies may have conflicting advice because research is constantly improving ; just 21 % say research studies can not really be trusted because so many studies have conflicting advice .
For adults with Hispanic ancestry who do not self-identify as Hispanic , 81 % say they have never considered themselves Hispanic or Latino . The reasons for this are many and are often linked to mixed backgrounds , limited contact with Hispanic relatives and few Hispanic cultural links , according to a follow-up open-ended question . For example , some 27 % said they do not consider themselves Hispanic because they have a mixed Hispanic and non-Hispanic background or that their Hispanic ancestry is too distant . Another 16 % said they do not consider themselves Hispanic despite their Hispanic ancestry because of their upbringing or that they have little contact with their Hispanic relatives ; 15 % said the reason they say they are not Hispanic is because they do not speak Spanish or have no link to Hispanic culture ; 12 % said they do not look Hispanic or they identify as another race ; and 9 % said they were born in the U.S. and consider themselves American .
Perceptions of personal threat from the outbreak – whether physical or financial – are also associated with higher levels of psychological distress . Among those who see the outbreak as a major threat to their personal health , about one-third ( 32 % ) fall into the high distress category ; among those who say it is not a threat to their health , just 16 % do . And 30 % who see the outbreak as a major threat to their personal financial situation fall into the high distress category , compared with 18 % among those who say it is not a threat .
Moaddel : Findings from the survey in Saudi Arabia were particularly interesting . While over 70 % of the Saudi respondents mentioned the most conservative type of dress as the appropriate style ( pictures No . 1 and No . 2 ) , at the same time a much higher percentage of Saudis ( 47 % ) than Egyptians ( 14 % ) , Iraqis ( 27 % ) or Pakistanis ( 22 % ) support freedom of choice for women to dress as they wish .
To better understand this , we added a follow-up to our initial questions on diversity , gender equality , family ties and religion : Is this a good or bad thing for the country ? To accurately classify these responses , we took people who said there was an increase ( for example in diversity ) and that this was a good thing , and then combined them with people who said diversity had decreased and they felt this was bad . On the other side , we combined people who said there was an increase and that it was bad with those who saw a decrease in diversity and thought it was good for society .
During the early stages of the outbreak 's economic fallout , 90 % of the decrease in employment – or 2.6 million of the total loss of 2.9 million between February and March – arose from positions that could not be teleworked , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of federal government data .
Since August 2019 , the share of Republicans with a favorable impression of the court has declined 10 percentage points ( from 85 % to 75 % ) , while Democrats ' views have become more positive , increasing from 57 % to 67 % .
Roughly half of both Republicans and Republican leaners ( 47 % ) and Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 46 % ) say the campaign against ISIS has not made much of a difference when it comes to terrorist attacks on American soil . However , Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say the military campaign has increased the chances of a terrorist attack in the U.S. ( 33 % vs. 18 % ) , while Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say the campaign against ISIS has decreased the chances of a terrorist attack ( 32 % vs. 18 % ) .
It turns out that people think different kinds of public and social settings warrant different sensitivities about civil behavior . For instance , fully 77 % of all adults think it is generally OK for people to use their cellphones while walking down the street and 75 % believe it is OK for others to use phones on public transit . But only 38 % think it is generally OK for others to use cellphones at restaurants and just 5 % think it is generally OK to use a cellphone at a meeting .
The 36 identified Freedom Caucus members had an average score of +0.659 , more than a third higher than the average score for all other House GOP members ( +0.455 ) ; the least conservative Freedom Caucus member ( Steve Pearce of New Mexico ) is still more conservative than the average non-Freedom Caucus House Republican . Freedom Caucus members also have spent decidedly less time in the House . Of the 36 identified members , 26 ( 72 % ) were first elected in 2010 or later , compared with 54 % of other House Republicans .
The economy , meanwhile , continues to dominate both public interest and news coverage . Three-in-ten say they followed reports about the economy more closely than any other story last week . Another 17 % say they followed reports on Obama 's budget proposal most closely and 8 % say they followed administration plans to expand federal regulation of financial institutions most closely . Stories about the economy – including Obama 's budget proposal – filled up 41 % of the media newshole , according to the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism . With Obama 's historic campaign dominating media coverage in the run up to the Nov. 4 election , the public at times seemed to think the Democratic candidate was overexposed . In early August , about two-thirds of Republicans ( 67 % ) said they were hearing too much about Obama , compared with 51 % of independents and 34 % of Democrats .
Seattle , San Francisco and Boston are notable not only because they have relatively few Christians , but also for their considerable populations of religious `` nones '' ( atheists , agnostics and those who say their religion is `` nothing in particular '' ) . A third or more of people in each of those metropolitan areas ( 37 % in Seattle , 35 % in San Francisco and 33 % in Boston ) are religious `` nones . ''
Highly educated women are more likely to work during the pregnancy preceding their first birth than less educated women . The latest data indicate that 87 % of women with a bachelor 's degree or higher worked while pregnant with their first child . By contrast , just 28 % of women without a high school diploma worked while pregnant with their first child , a disparity that parallels full-time employment rates by educational attainment more broadly .
Though 56 % of working mothers say it 's very or somewhat difficult to balance work and family responsibilities , 78 % say they 're doing an `` excellent '' or `` very good '' job as parents .
Last week , foreign news dominated the public 's news interest with more than seven-in-ten saying they tracked either news about Japan ( 57 % ) or about allied air strikes in Libya ( 15 % ) more closely than any other news . That is rarely the case for this index , which measures public interest in a wide range of stories .

About eight-in-ten in Lebanon say that Iran is more influential in the Middle East today than it was 10 years ago . Large majorities across all religious groups hold this view : 89 % of Shia Muslims , 77 % of Sunni Muslims and 71 % of Christians . The view that Iran now plays a less important role in the region is held by roughly a quarter in both Israel ( 24 % ) and Turkey ( 26 % ) .

Survey experiments also may involve randomizing specific details within a question to better understand nuances in views . For example , a report about Americans ' views about elections included a question that described a hypothetical election with 1 million voters in which one person voted even though they were not eligible to do so . Around four-in-ten Americans ( 41 % ) said this would be a `` major problem . '' But the question also included a set of variations that were randomly assigned . In those versions , the number of people who were described as voting despite being ineligible to vote changed . While some people received the scenario in which one person voted despite being ineligible , others were asked about 10 , 100 , 1,000 , or 10,000 people voting despite being ineligible . The experiment found that 69 % of U.S. adults said that 10,000 people voting despite being ineligible was a major problem , compared with 41 % who said the same about one ineligible person voting . Since respondents were randomly assigned into each version of the question , these differences can be attributed to the changing information itself , not the attributes of the people who responded .
Among the 47 countries included in the 2007 poll , China had the highest level of social trust : Almost eight-in-ten Chinese ( 79 % ) agreed with the statement `` Most people in this society are trustworthy .

'' A median of just 38 % think `` developing countries should do just as much as rich countries because they will produce most of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions in the future . '' Notably , the U.S. is among a small group of countries in which half or more believe developing countries should do just as much – half of Americans hold this view , while only four-in-ten want rich countries to shoulder more of the costs .
Nearly two-thirds of American adults ( 65 % ) use social networking sites , up from 7 % when Pew Research Center began systematically tracking social media usage in 2005 . Pew Research reports have documented in great detail how the rise of social media has affected such things as work , politics and political deliberation , communications patterns around the globe , as well as the way people get and share information about health , civic life , news consumption , communities , teenage life , parenting , dating and even people 's level of stress . A special analysis of 27 national surveys of Americans across the past decade documents this substantial spread of technology throughout the population , although the overall number of users of social networking sites has leveled off since 2013.1 At the same time , there continues to be growth in social media usage among some groups that were not among the earliest adopters , including older Americans .
91 % of American adults say that consumers have lost control over how personal information is collected and used by companies .
Those who face the greatest financial insecurity are the most reliant on government benefits ; more than half of the least secure group reports receiving at least one type of means-tested government benefit . They also are more likely than the most financially secure to say that `` the government should do more to help needy Americans , even if it means going deeper into debt . '' Among the least financially secure , 60 % express this view ; no more than half in any other group ( including just 34 % of the most financially secure ) say the government should do more to assist the needy if it means adding to the debt . Similarly , the least secure are far more likely than the most secure to say that `` poor people have hard lives because government benefits do n't go far enough to help them live decently . ''
More than eight-in-ten ( 83 % ) say they are very or somewhat confident that CDC officials are doing a good job , including 40 % who are very confident . Most ( 73 % ) also say they are confident in state and local government officials . The public is less confident in how President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are responding to the crisis : Fewer than half are very or somewhat confident that Trump ( 45 % ) and Pence ( 48 % ) are doing a good job responding to the crisis .
Even though America 's image has declined since Trump 's election , on balance the U.S. still receives positive marks – across the 25 nations polled , a median of 50 % have a favorable opinion of the U.S. , while 43 % offer an unfavorable rating . However , a median of only 27 % say they have confidence in President Trump to do the right thing in world affairs ; 70 % lack confidence in him .
The average age at which U.S. women first become mothers is 26.4 – comparable to the age at first birth among Latvian women but lower than in the 28 other nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) for which data were available . At the other end of the spectrum , South Korean women are the oldest when they first give birth ( 31.4 years , on average ) . On average , women in Greece , Luxembourg , Switzerland , Japan , Spain and Italy are also in their 30s when they become mothers . Not only are U.S. women becoming moms sooner than many of their OECD counterparts , they are also ending their childbearing years with larger families – 2.2 children , on average . Of the 21 other OECD nations with available data , 20 have lower lifetime fertility , the only exception being Iceland . There , women at the end of their childbearing years have had 2.3 children , on average . In contrast , lifetime fertility dips below 2.0 in 17 other nations , going as low as 1.5 in Germany , Italy , Spain and Japan . All told , the share of U.S. women at the end of their childbearing years who ever had a baby now stands at 86 % , while 14 % are childless . This is about the same as rates of childlessness among women in Norway , Slovenia , Sweden and France . In contrast , almost one-in-four German women ( 23 % ) end their childbearing years having never had a baby . Rates of childlessness reach 20 % or more in Finland , Spain and Italy , as well . At the other end of the spectrum , only 9 % of women at the end of their childbearing years in the Czech Republic have never given birth .
Not surprisingly , responses are sharply divided along partisan lines . Two-thirds of Republican voters ( 66 % ) say Trump would do an excellent or good job helping workers get the training they need , while only 6 % of Democratic voters agree . Even so , a significant minority of Republicans ( 30 % ) say Trump would do only a fair or poor job at this .
Views about the role of human activity in climate change also vary by education among Democrats , but not among Republicans . Democrats who have graduated from college are more likely to say human activity contributes a great deal to climate change than Democrats without a college degree . For example , 86 % of Democrats with a postgraduate degree say human activity contributes a great deal to climate change , compared with a smaller majority ( 58 % ) of Democrats with no college experience . Among Republicans , comparably small shares across level of education see human activity as contributing a great deal to climate change .
An estimated 2.3 million Hispanics of Salvadoran origin resided in the United States in 2017 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey . Salvadorans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Salvadoran origin ; this includes immigrants from El Salvador and those who trace their family ancestry to El Salvador . Salvadorans are the third-largest population ( tied with Cubans ) of Hispanic origin living in the United States , accounting for 4 % of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017 . Since 2000 , the Salvadoran-origin population has increased 225 % , growing from 711,000 to 2.3 million over the period . At the same time , the Salvadoran foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 142 % , from 539,000 in 2000 to 1.3 million in 2017 . By comparison , Mexicans , the nation 's largest Hispanic origin group , constituted 36.6 million , or 62 % , of the Hispanic population in 2017 .
More Europeans believe immigrants want to be distinct rather than adopt their new countries ' customs . A median of 38 % say migrants are willing to adopt their customs and way of life while 51 % believe immigrants want to remain distinct from the broader society .
By 57 % to 34 % , Republicans younger than 50 support a policy to grant permanent legal status to immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally when they were children . By contrast , Republicans ages 50 and older are evenly divided ( 45 % favor , 45 % oppose ) . There is a similar divide by ideology : Most moderate and liberal Republicans ( 58 % ) support this immigration proposal , while conservative Republicans are split ( 46 % favor , 44 % oppose ) . Republican women are somewhat more likely than men to back this proposal , and Republicans who are college graduates express more support than those who have not graduated from college . While majorities of nearly all Republican groups back substantially expanding the wall along the U.S. border with Mexico , those ages 18 to 49 are less likely to support this policy than those 50 and older ( 60 % compared with 83 % ) . And support for an expended border wall is significantly higher among conservative Republicans ( 81 % ) than among moderates and liberals ( 55 % ) .
These demographic changes are impacting Cuban Americans ' views of Cuba . For example , among more recent immigrant arrivals , 49 % say Cuban Americans and people living in Cuba share `` a lot '' of values in common , according to a new analysis of a 2013 Pew Research Center survey of Hispanics . By contrast , Cuban immigrants who arrived before 1990 hold a different view : 41 % say there is `` only a little '' or `` almost nothing '' in common between Cuban Americans and people living in Cuba . ( The sample size of those born in the U.S. is too small to provide reliable estimates . )
When it comes to immigration policy , roughly seven-in-ten ( 71 % ) continue to support a way for undocumented immigrants to gain legal status if certain requirements are met . One-in-four ( 25 % ) say they should not be allowed to stay . Most of those who say there should be a pathway to legal status support the ability for undocumented immigrants to apply for citizenship : 42 % overall say they should be able to apply for citizenship , while 25 % of the public thinks they should be able to apply for permanent residency , but not citizenship .
However , the higher-income households have not abandoned traditional media altogether ; they also turn to print and television , especially for local news . Asked about various platforms where they might get the news on a typical day , 76 % o those from higher-income households watch local and national news shows on television , 51 % of this higher-income group said they get local news from a print version of a newspaper , and 22 % read a print version of a newspaper for national news .1
Views on this question are strongly aligned with partisan affiliation . While 72 % of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say that government regulations are necessary to promote adoption of renewable energy sources , 65 % of Republicans and Republican leaners say the private marketplace can accomplish that goal without government regulations .
Yet Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to view members of the opposing party as unpatriotic . A 63 % majority of Republicans say that , compared with other Americans , Democrats are `` more unpatriotic . '' Just 23 % of Democrats say the same about Republicans .
The U.S. decision to restore relations with Cuba had strong support in Latin America . A majority across five Latin American countries surveyed in the spring of 2015 said they approved of the thawing of relations between the U.S. and Cuba . Nearly eight-in-ten in Chile ( 79 % ) , Argentina ( 78 % ) and Venezuela ( 77 % ) said they approved of the renewal of relations between the U.S. and Cuba , as did 67 % of those in Brazil and 54 % of those in Mexico . There was similarly broad support for ending the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba . Support for ending the embargo was stronger among Latin Americans with higher incomes , compared with lower-income respondents .
The JOLTS program does n't produce state-level data , but it does indicate that the South had the most job openings in April of any region – nearly 2.2 million – though the openings rate there ( 3.9 % ) was slightly below that of the nation as a whole . The Midwest had the nation 's highest regional openings rate ( 4.4 % ) , followed by the Northeast ( 4.1 % ) ; the rate in the West lagged behind at 3.6 % . Nationally , workers appear to be in shortest supply in two service sectors : professional/business services and healthcare/social assistance . Both had well over 1 million job openings in April – roughly one-third more than the sector with the third-highest number , accommodation and food services . All three of those sectors had openings rates of 5 % or higher , as did the catchall `` other services '' sector .
Migrants fleeing active conflict zones had the best chance of winning asylum , according to decision data from the first half of 2015 . Among the largest refugee groups by nationality , nearly all ( 94.8 % ) of those claiming Syrian citizenship succeeded in obtaining asylum , followed by Eritreans ( 88.5 % ) and Iraqis ( 87.1 % ) . On the other hand , the large numbers of applicants from the Balkans , which has been mostly at peace since 2001 , had less success : Only 6.4 % of Albanians , 1.9 % of Kosovars and 1.3 % of Serbs gained EU asylum in the first half of this year .
Across the 18 countries surveyed by Pew in both 2009 and 2011 , the median percentage saying China will replace or already has replaced the U.S. as the world 's leading superpower increased from 40 % in 2009 to 47 % two years later . Meanwhile , the median percentage saying China will never replace the U.S. fell from 44 % to 36 % .
However , when it comes to concerns about North Korea 's nuclear arsenal , there is a slight partisan difference . Roughly three-quarters of Republicans ( 74 % ) are very concerned about the weapons program , compared with 66 % of Democrats . There is a larger division by age on concern about the North 's nukes . Nearly eight-in-ten Americans ages 50 and older ( 78 % ) say they are very concerned about North Korea having nuclear weapons , compared with only 42 % of 18- to 29-year-olds .
While on balance people in these nations express largely positive judgments about the personal and societal impact of technologies , they also express significant concerns over the effects mobile phones and online connectivity might have on young people . Worries that mobile phones might expose children to immoral or harmful content are a key flashpoint in these fears . A median of 79 % of adults in these 11 countries – and majorities in all countries surveyed – say people should be very concerned about this . More broadly , a median of 54 % say the increasing use of the internet has had a bad influence on children in their country , and a median of 63 % say the same about mobile phones . Coupled with these concerns , many parents say they try to be vigilant about what their children are doing and seeing on their phones .3 Among parents whose children have mobile phones , a median of 50 % say they monitor what their children do on their mobile devices . Parents who are themselves smartphone or social media users are more likely than non-users to monitor their child 's phone in this way . Along with monitoring their children 's activities on their mobile devices , a median of 52 % of parents whose children have mobile phones have tried to limit the time their children spend with their phones .
Part of the reason behind the absence of data on this group is the size of the multiracial population – it 's still relatively small . As you note , we estimate that only about 6.9 % of the adult population has a mixed-race background . And by the Census Bureau 's definition the share is just 2.1 % . That means even large , nationally representative surveys typically include too few mixed-race adults to analyze , much less contain sufficiently sized samples of individual multiracial groups such as white and black or white and Asian biracial adults .
Yet it remains the case that the differences between the two parties are starker than those within the two parties . Across 30 political values – encompassing attitudes about guns , race , immigration , foreign policy and other realms – the average partisan gap is 39 percentage points . Across all 30 political values , the differences between Republicans and Democrats dwarf all other differences by demographics or other factors . The 39-point average gap is more than twice the difference between white and nonwhite adults ( 17 percentage points ) ; people who regularly attend religious services and those who do not ( 14 points ) ; college graduates and those who have not completed college ( 10 points ) ; younger and older adults ( also 10 points ) ; and men and women ( 6 points ) .
New York , Los Angeles and Washington , D.C. , are the financial , entertainment and political capitals of the United States – and that may help explain why they are home to a disproportionately large share of the nation 's newsroom employees . About one-in-five newsroom employees ( 22 % ) live in these three metro areas , which , by comparison , are home to 13 % of all U.S. workers , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data covering the period from 2013 to 2017 . Long known as the media capital of the world , New York , at 12 % , has the greatest share of all U.S. newsroom employees – those who work as reporters , editors , photographers and videographers in the newspaper , broadcasting and internet publishing industries . This is more than twice the share living in the Los Angeles and Washington , D.C. , metro areas , which are each home to 5 % of the nation 's newsroom employees .
American voters are generally skeptical that either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump would make a `` great '' or `` good '' president . But another dynamic in the 2016 presidential election is the significant share of voters who say their vote is based more on which candidate they are against rather than which one they are for . In a recent Pew Research Center survey , 53 % of Clinton supporters say they consider their vote more in support of her , while 46 % say their vote is more against Trump . Negative voting is somewhat more prevalent among Trump supporters : 53 % say their vote is primarily against Clinton . Fewer ( 44 % ) say their vote is in support of Trump .
About six-in-ten Germans name France as one of their country 's top two foreign policy partners , while roughly one-third name the U.S . These results are consistent across a range of political parties : Supporters of the CDU/CSU , their coalition partner the SPD , the Left Party and the Greens all rank France and the U.S. as Germany 's most important foreign policy allies . Russia and China rank third and fourth , respectively , as the most important foreign policy partner across selected political parties except for the Greens , where these countries ' rankings are reversed .
These shifts are particularly pronounced among ideological partisans . In 2015 , liberal Democrats and Democratic leaners were divided in their assessments of whether their side was losing more ( 44 % ) or winning more ( 46 % ) . Today , fully 81 % of liberal Democrats say they are losing more , while just 12 % say they are winning .
Slightly fewer than half of Americans ( 47 % ) believe that conducting basic scientific research to increase knowledge and understanding of space should be a top priority , with 40 % saying such research is an important but lower priority . Some 41 % say developing technologies that could be adapted for uses other than space exploration should be a top priority , and 44 % characterize it as an important but lower priority for NASA . And 38 % believe NASA should make it a top priority to conduct scientific research on how space travel affects human health , while 41 % see it as an important but lower priority .
As governments around the world turn to technology to help fight the spread of COVID-19 , a majority of Americans are skeptical that tracking someone 's location through their cellphone would help curb the outbreak . At the same time , the public holds mixed views on when – and if – this type of monitoring is acceptable . Six-in-ten Americans say that if the government tracked people 's locations through their cellphone it would not make much of a difference in limiting the spread of the virus , according to a new Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults conducted April 7 - 12 , 2020 . Smaller shares of Americans – about four-in-ten – believe this type of monitoring would help a lot ( 16 % ) or a little ( 22 % ) in limiting the spread of COVID-19 . Across demographic groups , roughly half or more believe this type of tracking would have little impact on slowing the COVID-19 outbreak . Still , Democrats ( 46 % ) and independents ( 42 % ) are more likely than Republicans ( 31 % ) to say that if the government tracked people 's locations through their cellphone during the outbreak it would help at least a little to limit the spread of the virus .
Nearly two-thirds of women ( 64 % ) favor stricter gun laws , compared with 55 % of men . Adults with at least a four-year college degree are more likely than those who have not completed to college to support stricter laws ( 72 % vs. 55 % ) .
In terms of the division of governing power , younger British adults are significantly less likely to say that some powers currently held by the EU should be returned to national governments . A majority ( 57 % ) of British adults younger than 30 say this , compared with 70 % of those ages 30 to 49 and 82 % of those 50 and older .
Opinions about the state of the nation 's economy are correlated with views of Trump 's job performance . People who have the most positive views of economic conditions – the 16 % of adults who say the economy is excellent – overwhelmingly approve of Trump . Nearly nine-in-ten ( 86 % ) approve of his performance , including 76 % who strongly approve .
Most Americans say the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak has been less effective than that of other wealthy nations . Around six-in-ten adults ( 62 % ) hold that view , while a quarter say America 's response has been about as effective and 13 % say it has been more effective , according to a survey conducted July 27 to Aug. 2 . Attitudes on this question are deeply divided along partisan lines , as they are on many questions related to the coronavirus . Almost nine-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents ( 87 % ) say the U.S. response has been less effective than that of other wealthy countries , while Republicans and GOP leaners are much more divided : Around a third ( 34 % ) say it has been less effective , 42 % say it has been about as effective and 22 % say it has been more effective .
Among the 65 % with a positive view of capitalism , many give reasons that contrast with criticisms of socialism . For example , while many who hold a negative view of socialism say it undermines initiative and makes people too dependent on government , nearly a quarter of those with a positive view of capitalism say it promotes individual opportunity ( 24 % say this ) . Nearly a quarter of Americans who have a positive view of capitalism ( 24 % ) say they hold their views because the system provides opportunity for individual financial growth . A similar share ( 22 % ) expresses general positivity towards capitalism , saying that the system works .
By comparison , about half say they have a lot or some trust in information provided by their state government ( 51 % ) and the Obama administration ( 50 % ) . Smaller percentages trust information from federal agencies ( 44 % ) , business corporations ( 41 % ) , Congress ( 37 % ) or candidates running for office ( 29 % ) .
The campaign was also a top news story last week . Roughly a quarter of the public ( 24 % ) followed campaign news very closely and 22 % listed this as their most closely followed story of the week . The Iraq war , which has been the public 's most closely followed news story throughout much of the year , has nearly fallen off the media 's radar screen . Last week , the national media devoted 2 % of its overall coverage to events in Iraq making it the ninth most heavily covered news story of the week . The previous week the war received 3 % of the national news coverage , placing it eighth overall . In spite of reduced coverage , the public is still following events in Iraq fairly closely , illustrating the continuing importance the public places on the story . Last week , 28 % of Americans paid very close attention to news about the current situation and events in Iraq and 13 % listed this as their most closely followed news story .
While President Obama has touted the involvement of other countries in the military effort against Islamic militants , the public is skeptical of the contributions made by U.S. allies . Overall , just 17 % say countries that are allies with the U.S. are doing enough to help the U.S. military effort against militants in Iraq and Syria ; far more ( 73 % ) say they are not doing enough .
All things considered , support for the Republicans and political energy among independents is closely linked to disillusionment with Obama 's policies and the president himself . Fully 69 % of independent voters who say Obama 's policies have made the economy worse favor the Republican candidate in their district – and 80 % say they will definitely vote . Disapproval of the president 's job performance , anger at the federal government and opposition to the health care legislation also are closely associated with support for Republican candidates . Independents who express these views also are highly likely to vote . Conversely , support for Obama and his policies is strongly associated with independents ' support for Democratic candidates ; in fact , 73 % of independents who say Obama 's policies have improved the economy plan to vote Democratic . But far fewer of those who express this opinion say they will definitely vote compared with independents who take a negative view of the impact of Obama 's policies ( 63 % vs. 80 % ) .
Those who have had the most exposure to information about the government surveillance programs also have some of the strongest views about data retention limits for certain kinds of organizations . These differences are particularly notable when considering social media sites . Among those who have heard `` a lot '' about the government collecting communications data as part of anti-terrorism efforts , 55 % say that the social media sites they use should not save any information regarding their activity , compared with 35 % of those who have heard `` a little '' about the government monitoring programs .
Big house , small house . Our studies of political polarization and partisan antipathy both found that the disagreements between Republicans and Democrats go far beyond political values and issues . They also have markedly different preferences about where they would like to live . Most Republicans ( 65 % ) say they would rather live in a community where houses are larger and farther apart and where schools and shopping are not nearby . A majority of Democrats ( 61 % ) prefer smaller houses within walking distance of schools and shopping .
We examined a comprehensive database of financial crises from 1970 through 2012 compiled and maintained by two economists for the International Monetary Fund to see just how unusual the current situation in Greece is . The IMF economists defined `` systemic banking crises '' as those with both `` significant signs of financial distress in the banking system , '' such as major bank runs , losses and liquidations , and significant policy interventions in response , such as deposit guarantees , nationalizations , recapitalizations , deposit freezes and bank holidays .
In many of the countries surveyed , people also tend to think their nation has positive economic relations with both the U.S. and China . For example , eight-in-ten Israelis give a positive evaluation of the economic ties between their country and China as well as the U.S. , and at least half or more say the same in Australia ( 72 % ) , Kenya ( 64 % ) , Nigeria ( 62 % ) , the Philippines ( 58 % ) and South Africa ( 52 % ) . South Korea stands out as the only country in which a plurality of people say current economic ties with the U.S. are positive , while those with China are negative ( 37 % ) . In contrast , Lebanese ( 39 % ) and Turks ( 30 % ) are more likely to see positive economic relations with China and not the U.S. , though these publics are relatively divided .
Since 1999 , in fact , 134 separate balanced-budget amendments have been formally introduced in either the House or Senate , making it the single most popular subject of amendment proposals over that timespan , according to our analysis of legislative data from the Library of Congress . Just in the current Congress , there are 18 separate balanced-budget proposals , out of a total of 64 proposed amendments to the Constitution .
Irish and Scotch-Irish Americans are most highly concentrated in a few areas of the country , reflecting their historical migration patterns . The poor Irish immigrants who fled their famine-stricken homeland in the 1840s and 1850s generally settled in or close to the Northeastern port cities where they first arrived . New England states continue to have the highest share of residents claiming Irish ancestry : Massachusetts ( 21.6 % ) , New Hampshire ( 21.0 % ) , Rhode Island ( 18.3 % ) , Vermont ( 17.9 % ) and Maine ( 17.6 % ) . The Scotch-Irish , who arrived earlier than the Irish in the early 1700s , moved to the more mountainous interior of what were then Britain 's American colonies . To this day , the states with the highest share of residents claiming Scotch-Irish ancestry are North Carolina ( 2.6 % ) , South Carolina ( 2.4 % ) , Tennessee ( 2.2 % ) and West Virginia ( 2.0 % ) .
Those who identify as Republicans are more likely than GOP leaners to view the Republican Party as conservative . While identical 11 % shares of both groups give the GOP the most conservative rating of 10 , Republicans on average are more likely to give the GOP a conservative score of 6 through 9 than are independents who lean Republican .
In some ways , the findings from the new survey mirror results from the head-to-head question about sympathies . Among the public overall , larger shares have favorable opinions of both the Israeli people ( 64 % very or somewhat favorable ) and the Israeli government ( 41 % ) than of the Palestinian people ( 46 % ) and the Palestinian government ( 19 % ) .
The Chinese and Japanese have held fairly strong and often negative stereotypes of each other for some time . And in some instances these views have worsened over the past decade . More than six-in-ten Japanese ( 64 % ) thought the Chinese were hardworking in 2006 , but now only around four-in-ten ( 42 % ) view them in that way . Again , it is older Japanese who are more critical ( although older Japanese are more likely to voice no opinion ) : Only 35 % of Japanese ages 50 and older associate the attribute hardworking with the Chinese , while 60 % of younger Japanese see the Chinese in that light .
Republicans are divided ideologically over stricter environmental regulations . Among the roughly two-thirds of Republicans and Republican leaners who describe their political views as conservative , 60 % say stricter laws cost too many jobs and hurt the economy . Among the party 's moderates and liberals ( who make up about a third of all Republicans and GOP leaners ) , 60 % say stricter environmental laws are worth the cost . There also are gender , age and educational differences in these attitudes . Women ( 69 % ) are more likely than men ( 58 % ) to say stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost . And while majorities in every age group say stricter environmental laws are worth it , a larger share of those ages 18 to 29 ( 72 % ) say this compared with those who are older than 50 ( 60 % ) .
Many Asian countries – including China , Korea , Japan and Vietnam – use a lunar calendar in addition to the solar calendar commonly used in the United States . People in those countries – as well as here in the United States – will start celebrating the Lunar New Year this weekend . Overall , about two-thirds of Chinese , Korean , Japanese and Vietnamese Americans ( 68 % ) celebrate the Lunar New Year , or what is often referred to as the Chinese New Year . Commemoration of the Lunar New Year is highest among Vietnamese Americans ( 93 % ) and Chinese Americans ( 82 % ) – who are about as likely to celebrate the Lunar New Year as to celebrate Thanksgiving . Fewer Korean Americans ( 45 % ) and Japanese Americans ( 30 % ) say they celebrate the Lunar New Year .
Establishing a way for most unauthorized immigrants to stay in the country legally is the top immigration policy goal for Hispanics in the United States , with more than half ( 54 % ) saying it is very important , according to a national Pew Research Center survey of Hispanic adults conducted in December . While a significant partisan gap exists on this issue , strong majorities of Hispanic Democrats and Republicans say this immigration policy goal is at least somewhat important .
While supporters of each candidate are more likely to turn to their preferred candidate 's social media , the data also reveal some political cross-pollination . Among registered voters , one-in-ten Trump supporters go to Clinton 's social media posts , which is similar to the 13 % of Clinton supporters who turn to Trump 's . What 's more , the rate at which these registered voters turn to the opposing candidate 's social media feed is about on par with the rate at which they turn to their preferred candidate 's website or emails : About one-in-ten Clinton supporters ( 11 % ) turn to her website and the same portion turn to her emails , where as 10 % of Trump 's supporters turn to his website and 6 % to his emails . Very few turn to the websites and emails of the opposing candidate .
Obama and his administration had been viewed positively by LGBT Americans even before this most recent expression of support for LGBT rights : The Pew Research Center 's survey of 1,197 LGBT adults , conducted this spring , found that Obama enjoyed significantly higher favorability ratings among LGBT adults than the general public . And according to the national exit polls , lesbian , gay and bisexual voters supported Obama 76 % to 22 % over Mitt Romney in the 2012 election . In the same survey , Obama was mentioned most frequently when respondents were asked to name national public figures most responsible for advancing LGBT rights : About a quarter ( 23 % ) of LGBT adults volunteered Obama .
The composition of networks of friends varies widely across immigrant generations . Most ( 77 % ) immigrant Latinos say all or most of their friends are Latinos . But this share drops to 55 % among second-generation self-identified Latinos and only 37 % among third or higher generation self-identified Latinos .
But on the specific benefits of trade , Germans and Americans are less convinced . For example , only about three-in-ten Germans and Americans say that trade increases wages . Just under four-in-ten in each country say trade with other countries creates jobs . And 32 % in Germany and 37 % in the U.S. say trade decreases prices , which is supposed to be one of the primary benefits of international trade .
Both Muslims and the general public also were asked if there are circumstances under which targeting and killing civilians can be justified in order to further a political , social or religious cause . Roughly eight-in-ten U.S. Muslims ( 84 % ) say such tactics can rarely ( 8 % ) or never ( 76 % ) be justified . The share of Muslims who say such tactics can often or sometimes be justified ( 12 % ) is similar to the share saying this among the general public ( 14 % ) . And Muslims are more likely than the public as a whole to say that targeting civilians for political , social or religious causes can never be justified .
Roughly three-quarters of U.S. Catholics ( 77 % ) say the church should allow birth control , while solid majorities also say the Vatican should permit priests to get married ( 72 % ) and female priests ( 68 % ) . Half ( 50 % ) say the church should recognize same-sex marriages .
Congregants may not be physically sitting in the pews each Sunday , but their house of worship is most likely streaming or recording its services so that people can access them virtually . Among U.S. adults who report attending religious services at least monthly , 82 % say that the place of worship they most often attend is streaming or recording its services so that people can watch them online or on TV . About one-in-eight ( 12 % ) say their primary place of worship has not done this , while the remainder say they do n't know ( 5 % ) . More than eight-in-ten churchgoing Christians say their primary church offers streaming or recorded services online or on TV , including roughly nine-in-ten evangelical ( 92 % ) and mainline Protestants ( 86 % ) who say this . Most Catholics ( 79 % ) and Protestants in the historically black tradition ( 73 % ) also say their churches are making religious services available remotely .
While many Americans and Germans name China as the most important partner , negative attitudes toward the Asian superpower have increased in both countries over the past year . The two publics have also become more likely to prioritize U.S.-German ties over relations with China . In the September 2020 survey , 55 % of Americans prefer to have a close relationship with Germany rather than China ( 35 % ) . This is a significant change from just April of this year , when 44 % wanted a close relationship with Germany and 43 % wanted the same with China . A similar shift is seen in Germany . In April , nearly equal numbers wanted to have a close relationship with China ( 36 % ) as said the U.S. ( 37 % ) . But now , a majority of Germans say they prefer the U.S. ( 55 % ) over China ( 27 % ) , similar to sentiment in late 2019 , before the pandemic .
The party affiliation of Latino registered voters mirrors how they intend to vote in the congressional elections , according to a September survey . If the election for Congress were being held today , 63 % of Latino registered voters said they would support the Democratic congressional candidate in their district , while 29 % said they would support the Republican candidate .
Income and education also influence how people look for a new church . In some cases , church `` shoppers '' with higher incomes are more likely than less-affluent adults to research a potential new religious congregation . For instance , among the roughly half of Americans who have looked for a new congregation , 44 % of those with family incomes of $ 75,000 or more read about the congregation online , compared with 37 % of those with incomes between $ 30,000 and $ 74,999 , and about three-in-ten ( 28 % ) with incomes below $ 30,000 . People with higher incomes also are more likely to visit houses of worship to attend services and to talk to friends or colleagues before choosing a new congregation .
Trzaskowski formerly served as a member of European Parliament and advocates greater integration with the EU . More than eight-in-ten Poles ( 84 % ) have a favorable view of the EU , the highest share among countries in the region . Additionally , about two-thirds ( 67 % ) think membership in the union is a good thing for Poland . Views of the EU and its value for Poles have grown more positive in recent years . Between 2018 and 2019 , the share of Polish adults with a favorable view of the EU rose 12 points , from 72 % to 84 % . Poles have also become more likely to see EU membership positively : The share who say that membership in the EU has been a good thing for Poland rose from 48 % in 2012 to 67 % in 2019 .
The Pew Research Center projections have assumed that the annual immigration level , now about 1.4 million people , will increase slowly by 1 % per year , reaching 2.1 million immigrants in 2050 . ( Figure 3 ) With the Center 's immigration assumption , the rate of immigration remains roughly constant over the 45-year projection horizon at 0.48 % per year , or just under five immigrants per 1,000 population for each year . The rate is slightly below the rate for the first half of this decade and equal to the average for the last 35 years . ( Figure 4 )
The Daily Show attracts a much younger news consumer than cable and network news shows . The median age of Web-using adults who got news from The Daily Show was 36 years last year , similar to that of its then-companion show , The Colbert Report ( 33 years ) . This is much younger than for other television news shows , both on cable and broadcast networks , including the network evening news programs and cable news shows like O'Reilly , Anderson Cooper 360 and the Rachel Maddow Show .
As Table One and Chart One show , the presidential and national party campaign organizations accounted for 93 % of the estimated ad spending detected through the Evaliant software in the first seven months of 2004 : Kerry for President ( 49.5 % ) , the Republican National Committee ( 18.3 % ) , Bush for President ( 15.7 % ) , and the Democratic National Committee ( 9.7 % ) . The 527s have largely ignored online advertising . ( As of the first week in September , Swift Boat Veterans for Truth had not run any online ads . )
Today , roughly two-thirds of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters ( 65 % ) say they have an excellent ( 23 % ) or good ( 42 % ) impression of the Democratic presidential candidates as a group . By comparison , in September 2015 , only about half of Democratic voters ( 51 % ) said the same .
Wire services like the Associated Press account for the major share of federal government coverage in local newspapers . Regardless of whether a local newspaper has its own D.C. correspondent , wire service coverage carries much of the weight when it comes to informing readers about the federal government . Among the four papers with a D.C. correspondent , fully 52 % of stories about the federal government came from wire services , compared with 8 % that came from the D.C. correspondents . Among four papers studied without their own D.C. correspondent , reliance on wire coverage was even more pronounced – accounting for fully 62 % of all federal government news .
Large majorities of blacks ( 84 % ) and Hispanics ( 71 % ) disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job . Whites are evenly split in their views . By 67 % to 27 % , white evangelical Protestants continue to approve of the job Trump is doing . Among white mainline Protestants , about half ( 52 % ) approve of Trump 's performance ( 40 % disapprove ) . On balance , Catholics are more likely to disapprove ( 55 % ) than approve ( 41 % ) of how Trump is handling his job as president . Ratings are even more negative among the religiously unaffiliated , 71 % of whom say they disapprove of Trump .
Indeed , just 31 % of Mexican Catholics favor changes to church policy on the priesthood – that is , allowing priests to marry or women to become priests . By contrast , about half or more of Mexican-American Catholics say that priests should have the option to marry , and that the priesthood should be open to women .
By contrast , seven-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners are very ( 43 % ) or somewhat ( 27 % ) confident that Mueller 's investigation will be fair . The share of Democrats who express confidence in Mueller has held mostly stable over four surveys conducted since last December .
Rural residents are more likely than people in suburban and urban areas to know all or most of their neighbors , but they are n't more likely to interact with them . Four-in-ten rural residents say they know all or most of their neighbors , compared with 24 % of urban residents and 28 % of suburban residents . But rural residents have in-person conversations with their neighbors about as often as those in other community types . Roughly half of rural residents ( 47 % ) say they have face-to-face conversations with their neighbors at least once a week , with similar shares of suburban ( 49 % ) and urban residents ( 53 % ) saying the same .
Three-quarters of Americans agree that it is sometimes necessary to use military force to maintain order in the world ; this view is shared by seven-in-ten in Britain and narrower majorities in France and Spain ( 62 % each ) . Germans are evenly divided , with half saying the use of force is sometimes necessary and half saying it is not .
As a whole , Republicans are more bearish about the national economy than Democrats . Just 16 % of Republicans rated the economy as excellent or good in our May survey , compared with 36 % of Democrats . And Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say the economy is n't recovering . One-in-three Republicans ( 33 % ) said the economy was n't recovering at all , compared with 7 % of Democrats . In a January survey , more Republicans ( 63 % ) than Democrats ( 47 % ) said they were falling behind financially .
A similar pattern to those seen with the urban-rural and racial composition of each district emerges in the relationship between the partisan leanings of a district and deaths attributable to the coronavirus . In the early stages of the pandemic , the hardest hit districts were overwhelmingly `` blue '' parts of the country . COVID-19 deaths in the March through May period were more than four times as high in strongly Democratic districts ( where Republican congressional candidates received less than 25 % of the vote in the 2018 midterm elections ) as in districts where Republican candidates won more than 60 % of the 2018 vote .
While making or receiving payments is one of the least common cell phone activities , it is much more common in the region where mobile money is a phenomenon – Africa , and more specifically , Kenya and its neighbor Uganda . Nearly seven-in-ten Kenyans ( 68 % ) who own a cell phone say they regularly use their mobile device to make or receive payments . Half in Uganda say this as well . Meanwhile , even though only 29 % of mobile owners in South Africa and 24 % in Senegal say they use their phones for monetary transactions , these are still among the highest percentages across all the countries surveyed . Only in Russia ( 24 % ) do as many cell owners use their device for such purposes . In the 18 countries surveyed outside of sub-Saharan Africa , a median of only 8 % use their cell phones for making and receiving payments .
Those who say it is never acceptable to use an anonymous source are roughly three times as likely to say it has a great deal of influence on whether they think a story is credible ( 49 % vs. 15 % of those who say it is acceptable in special cases and 14 % of those who say always acceptable ) . Still , majorities of all three groups say that an anonymous source has at least some influence on their trust in a story .
The share of Americans who use ride-hailing services has increased dramatically . Today , 36 % of U.S. adults say they have ever used a ride-hailing service such as Uber or Lyft , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in fall 2018 . By comparison , just 15 % of Americans said they had used these services in late 2015 , and one-third had never heard of ride-hailing before . Ride-hailing use has increased across most demographic groups , but adoption figures continue to vary by age , educational attainment and income level . For example , roughly half of Americans ages 18 to 29 ( 51 % ) say they have used a ride-hailing service , compared with 24 % of those ages 50 and older . Those whose annual household income is $ 75,000 or more are roughly twice as likely as those earning less than $ 30,000 to have used these services ( 53 % vs. 24 % ) . And over half of adults with a bachelor 's or advanced degree ( 55 % ) say they have used these services , compared with 20 % of those who have a high school diploma or less . Notably , adoption gaps between urban and rural Americans are present even within groups that collectively use ride-hailing services at high rates . For example , among Americans who earn $ 75,000 or more annually , urban residents are more than twice as likely to have used these services as high-income individuals living in rural communities ( 71 % vs. 32 % ) . Substantial urban-rural differences also exist among Americans with a college degree and among those ages 18 to 29 .
Conversely , television broadcasting employees now account for a larger portion of all newsroom employees , rising from 25 % in 2008 to 34 % in 2019 . The proportion for digital-native has tripled over the period evaluated , from 6 % of all newsroom employees in 2008 to 18 % in 2019 .
In addition to the general findings already described , the 14-country survey reveals important differences by age , with younger adults ( ages 18 to 29 ) more favorably inclined toward the UN and WHO as well as toward international cooperation in general . Among this cohort , 72 % say they have a positive view of the UN , compared with 58 % among those 50 and older . Age gaps also appear in support for the principle of cooperation between countries to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and for the WHO 's handling of the pandemic .
Most U.S adult Twitter users do n't tweet very often . A large majority of tweets come from a small minority of users . The median Twitter user produces two tweets per month , according to a 2019 study . However , among the most prolific tweeters – defined as those in the top 10 % in the number of tweets they send – the median user produces 138 tweets each month . And that group of highly prolific tweeters dominates discourse on the platform more broadly : 80 % of all tweets from American adults come from the top 10 % of tweeters .
But while the public backs airstrikes , there is widespread concern about the U.S. becoming too involved in Iraq . Overall , 51 % say their greater concern about military action is that the U.S. will go too far getting involved in the situation . Fewer ( 32 % ) say they are more concerned that the U.S. will not go far enough in stopping Islamic militants .
About one-in-ten ( 12 % ) say they very closely followed news about Steve Jobs announcing he is stepping down as Apple 's chief executive officer ; 3 % say this was the news they followed most closely . The Apple developments accounted for 2 % of the newshole measured by PEJ .
Among U.S. adults who attend religious services a few times a year or more often , almost half ( 45 % ) say they 're not sure whether the clergy at their congregation are Democrats or Republicans , and roughly a quarter ( 27 % ) say their clergy are a mix of both . When congregants think they know the political affiliation of their religious leaders , 16 % say their clergy are mostly Republicans , while a slightly smaller share say they are mostly Democrats ( 11 % ) . More broadly , respondents are satisfied with the amount of political talk they 're hearing from the pulpit . Among Americans who attend worship services a few times a year or more often , 72 % say there is about the right amount of political discussion in sermons , while fewer say there 's too much ( 11 % ) or not enough ( 14 % ) . ( The survey did n't ask how often politics are discussed at places of worship – just whether respondents were satisfied with the amount they hear . )
Voters approached the 2018 midterm elections with some trepidation about the voting process and many had concerns that U.S. election systems may be hacked . After the election , however , most say it was `` very easy '' to vote and confidence in election security has increased . About three-quarters of those who report casting ballots in the midterm elections ( 76 % ) say that voting was `` very easy . '' In a survey conducted in October , just 44 % of those who planned to vote expected that the process would be very easy .
In addition , while the budget deficit remains a very important issue for most voters , there continues to be broad agreement that the best way to reduce the budget deficit is with a combination of tax increases and cuts in major programs . In the new survey , fully 69 % of registered voters say the best way to reduce the federal budget deficit is with a combination of tax increases and spending cuts ; just 16 % say the focus should be mostly on cutting major programs and just 6 % say the deficit should be reduced mostly by increasing taxes .
Despite some well-publicized examples in which facial recognition technologies have misidentified individual people or struggled to recognize certain types of faces , most Americans consider these tools to be relatively effective . Roughly three-quarters of U.S. adults ( 73 % ) think facial recognition technologies are at least somewhat effective at accurately identifying individual people . Smaller majorities think these tools are effective at accurately assessing someone 's gender ( 63 % ) or race ( 61 % ) .
Clinton supporters ( 60 % ) are more likely than Trump supporters ( 51 % ) to view a concession as very important . Only about one in five of each candidate 's supporters ( 21 % of Trump backers , 16 % of Clinton backers ) say this is not important . By contrast , roughly twice as many Johnson and Stein supporters ( 41 % ) think it is not too or not at all important that the losing candidate publicly acknowledge the winner as the legitimate president .
The share of blacks serving in a presidential Cabinet was at or above parity with the population during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations . But there was only one black Cabinet secretary during Obama 's first term , and the same is true so far in Donald Trump 's administration . The highest level of black representation in a presidential Cabinet occurred during Bill Clinton 's first term , when four out of 15 Cabinet appointees were black . Throughout the rest of Clinton 's administration and George W. Bush 's two terms , the share remained high relative to the share of blacks in the U.S. population overall . When Obama took office , he appointed only one Cabinet member who was black – Attorney General Eric Holder . During Obama 's second term , there were four black Cabinet appointees . The only black Cabinet member to have been appointed by Trump so far in his presidency is Ben Carson , secretary of Housing and Urban Development .
A new Pew Research Center survey finds that , for the most part , the large majority of Americans do not feel that information overload is a problem for them . Some 20 % say they feel overloaded by information , a decline from the 27 % figure from a decade ago , while 77 % say they like having so much information at their fingertips . Two-thirds ( 67 % ) say that having more information at their disposals actually helps to simplify their lives .
Italians are also the least optimistic among the eight Western countries surveyed . Only 37 % of Italians think they will be at a higher spot on the ladder of life in five years . In contrast , in the United States — a country famous for its optimism — 55 % say they will be better off .
Throughout Europe governments are wrestling with how far to go to respond to calls to lift the veil and ban the head scarf . While the issue in the Netherlands involves full-face veils or burqas , head scarves also have divided publics across the continent . A 2005 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey in the Netherlands found that 51 % of the Dutch public favored banning head scarves in public .1 In Germany , 54 % also supported a ban while in France an even larger majority — 78 % — did so . But in Great Britain , a solid majority ( 62 % ) thought the banning of scarves was a bad idea . Opinion was more evenly divided in Spain , where 43 % said the ban is a good idea and 48 % opposed it .
About eight-in-ten ( 81 % ) Israeli adults are Jewish , while the remainder are mostly ethnically Arab and religiously Muslim ( 14 % ) , Christian ( 2 % ) or Druze ( 2 % ) . Overall , the Arab religious minorities in Israel are more religiously observant than Jews . And these groups all are largely isolated from one another socially ; there is virtually no religious intermarriage in Israel , and strong majorities of Jews , Muslims , Christians and Druze say all or most of their close friends belong to their own religious group .
Roughly one-in-four ( 27 % ) very closely followed news last week about the police shooting of African American teenager Michael Brown and subsequent protests in Ferguson , Missouri . Several other stories garnered similar interest , including the death of actor Robin Williams ( 27 % ) and news about the Ebola outbreak in Africa ( 25 % ) . Similar shares also tracked news about U.S. airstrikes in Iraq ( 23 % ) and the situation between Russia and Ukraine ( 22 % ) .
There continue to be wide differences across income categories in assessments of the impact of financial pressures , but health care costs is a top household financial pressure across all income levels . About half ( 53 % ) of households earning $ 100,000 or more a year say it affects their financial situations a lot ; about as many ( 52 % ) of those earning $ 30,000 a year or less say the same . On the impact of other pressures , there are some substantial differences across income groups . While about six-in-ten in lower income households say the prices of food and consumer goods impacts their finances a lot ( 59 % of those in households with incomes of less than $ 30,000 a year ) , four-in-ten of those in higher income households say the same ( 40 % of households making $ 75,000 annually or more ) .
Yet most of these users did not tweet about immigration regularly . On average , the large majority ( 84 % ) of those who tweeted about immigration with a link did so just once a week or less during the period studied . In contrast , a smaller core tweeted daily or more – 14 % of users in this dataset shared a tweet about immigration with a link daily , on average , with another 2 % doing so semi-daily ( more than once per day , but less than hourly ) , and fewer than 1 % posting hourly , on average . As a result , the large majority of users who tweeted weekly or less did not have a large impact on the overall volume of tweets about immigration that contained a link , producing only about a quarter of them ( 26 % ) . Instead , the users who produced the most tweets were those who tweeted daily ( 32 % of tweets ) . Semi-daily and hourly users each produced about one-in-five of them ( 20 % and 19 % , respectively ) . ( These user types – also referred to as tweeters – are used throughout the rest of the post . )
Overall , 44 % of Americans now say that it is a lot more difficult to be a Black person in the U.S. than it is to be a White person , while 32 % say it is a little more difficult and 23 % say it is no more difficult . The share saying it is a lot more difficult to be Black than White is now 9 percentage points higher than it was in the summer of 2016 . But while overall views have shifted , the shift has come exclusively from within the Democratic coalition . The attitudes of Trump supporters today look very similar to attitudes of Trump supporters four years ago : 45 % of Trump voters now say that it is no more difficult to be a Black person in the U.S. than to be a White person , while 44 % say Black people have it a little more difficult . Only about one-in-ten Trump supporters say that Black people have it a lot more difficult than White people . But while overall views have shifted , the shift has come exclusively from within the Democratic coalition . The attitudes of Trump supporters today look very similar to attitudes of Trump supporters four years ago : 45 % of Trump voters now say that it is no more difficult to be a Black person in the U.S. than to be a White person , while 44 % say Black people have it a little more difficult . Only about one-in-ten Trump supporters say that Black people have it a lot more difficult than White people .
In many countries , anti-Americanism is driven by disagreement with U.S. foreign policy . Perceptions of U.S. unilateralism , opposition to the war in Iraq , and reservations about the war on terrorism have fueled anti-American sentiments most dramatically in the Muslim world , although unpopular policies have hurt America 's image in other regions as well . Indians , however , largely approve of the way the U.S. conducts itself in the international arena . For example , Indians are less likely than others to believe the U.S. acts unilaterally on the world stage – 63 % of Indians say the U.S. takes into account the interests of other countries when making foreign policy decisions .
This view is particularly widespread in Western Europe , where more than eight-in-ten in France ( 91 % ) , Spain ( 91 % ) and Germany ( 85 % ) agree that the preferred marital model is one where husband and wife share a family 's financial burden as well as the household and child care responsibilities . More than eight-in-ten in Brazil ( 84 % ) and Kenya ( 81 % ) and at least three-quarters in China ( 78 % ) and Mexico ( 76 % ) share this view . Across predominantly Muslim countries , support for both spouses working is mixed . About nine-in-ten in Lebanon ( 92 % ) favor a double-income household and an egalitarian approach to tasks at home , as do 72 % in Turkey . In Indonesia , the majority in favor of dual workers both inside and outside the home is narrower ( 56 % ) , with 43 % of Indonesians saying that a marriage where the husband provides for the family and the wife takes care of the house and children is preferable . Egyptians and Jordanians are more divided ; 48 % and 47 % , respectively , embrace the egalitarian approach to marriage , while about four-in-ten ( 38 % in Egypt and 40 % in Jordan ) choose a more traditional arrangement . In contrast , Pakistanis are overwhelmingly of the opinion that a marriage where the husband bears the financial responsibility while the wife cares for the house and children is more satisfying ; nearly eight-in-ten ( 79 % ) share this view , compared with just 18 % of Pakistanis who favor a non-traditional approach .
Of the 12 stressful events that we studied , on average , women were aware of a larger number of events that had occurred among people they knew . On average , men were aware of 7 % fewer stressful events among their closest social ties .
The global economic crisis had a powerful effect across much of Central and Eastern Europe , and it hit especially hard in Hungary , which was forced to seek a financial bailout from the IMF , World Bank and European Union . The fall 2009 survey revealed the extent of Hungarian economic gloom : 94 % described the country 's economy as bad , nosing out Lithuania ( 93 % ) and Ukraine ( 91 % ) for the most negative assessment among the countries included in the poll .
Although early withdrawals from retirement accounts increased during the Great Recession and its aftermath , the difference was less than what one might have expected — largely , researchers from the Federal Reserve and the IRS found , because early withdrawals were so substantial in the years leading up to the recession . The data suggest that many families were under financial stress even during the apparently prosperous years of the mid-2000s .
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , conducted January 5 - 9 among 1,503 adults finds that by two-to-one ( 60 % to 27 % ) Americans see China 's economic strength as a greater threat than its military strength . And as Obama goes into talks with the Chinese president , a 53 % majority say it is very important for the U.S. to get tougher with China on trade and economic issues . Yet while Americans may see China as a problem , relatively few describe it as an adversary , and a 58 % majority say it is very important to build a stronger relationship between the U.S. and China . By comparison , promoting human rights and better environmental policies and practices are important , but lower priorities .
Overall , 65 % of U.S. adults say that they have personally worn a mask in stores or other businesses all or most of the time in the past month , while 15 % say they did this some of the time . Relatively small shares of adults say they hardly ever ( 9 % ) or never ( 7 % ) wore a mask in the past month , and 4 % say they have not gone to these types of places .
Meanwhile , 58 % of adults in India say that no matter who wins an election , things do not change very much . This again includes a majority of both BJP and Congress supporters .
About half of first marriages in the U.S. are likely to survive at least 20 years , according to government estimates . But for one demographic group , marriages last longer than most : College-educated women have an almost eight-in-ten chance of still being married after two decades . Researchers at the National Center for Health Statistics estimate that 78 % of college-educated women who married for the first time between 2006 and 2010 could expect their marriages to last at least 20 years . But among women who have a high school education or less , the share is only 40 % . The probability of a lasting first marriage is derived from marital history data from the National Survey of Family Growth , a nationally representative sample of women and men who were ages 15 to 44 between 2006 and 2010 . Estimates are based on an approach similar to that used to determine life expectancy and assume that marriage patterns in the future will follow patterns today . The findings refer only to opposite-sex marriages ; the sample size was too small to analyze same-sex marriages .
Cellphones are deeply embedded in the everyday experiences of most U.S. teens . Most notably , 72 % of teens say they at least sometimes check for messages or notifications as soon as they wake up ( with 44 % saying they often do this ) . And 57 % feel they often or sometimes have to respond to messages from other people immediately . Meanwhile , 31 % of teens say they lose focus in class because they are checking their cellphone – though just 8 % say this often happens to them , and 38 % say it never does . Teens across a range of demographic groups respond in similar ways to these questions about their cellphone use . However , teens ages 15 to 17 are particularly likely to say they check for messages as soon as they wake up – 49 % say they often do this , compared with 37 % of teens ages 13 to 14 .
Among the factors that affect household finances , the public ranks the cost of health care and the prices of food and consumer goods highest . About half of Americans say the cost of health care affects their household 's financial situation a lot ( 53 % ) , and nearly as many ( 48 % ) say the same about prices of food and consumer goods . Real estate values ( 37 % ) , gas prices ( 37 % ) and the availability of jobs ( 34 % ) are mentioned by about a third of Americans as affecting their household 's finances a lot . Only about two-in-ten say the same of the stock market ( 21 % ) or the federal budget deficit ( 22 % ) .
People are also suspicious of American power . In a 2004 Pew poll , majorities or pluralities in seven of the nine countries surveyed said the U.S.-led war on terrorism was not really a sincere effort to reduce international terrorism . This was true not only in Muslim countries such as Morocco and Turkey , but in France and Germany as well . The true purpose of the war on terrorism , according to these skeptics , is American control of Middle East oil and U.S. domination of the world .
The high educational attainment among young Americans today is reflected in the workforce . Four-in-ten Millennial workers ages 25 to 29 had at least a bachelor 's degree in 2016 . ( Overall , about one-third – 34 % – of Millennials ages 25 to 29 had at least a bachelor 's in 2016 . ) That compares with 32 % of Generation X workers and smaller shares of the Baby Boom and Silent generations when they were the same age . Employed Millennial women ( 46 % ) are particularly likely to have a bachelor 's degree or higher in comparison with Gen X women ( 36 % ) at the same age . Millennial men in the workforce are also more likely to hold at least a bachelor 's degree than their Gen X counterparts did as young adults .
In districts where GOP candidates for the House prevailed , 65 % of Republican voters say they are very confident votes in their community were counted as intended , while 53 % of Democratic voters in these districts say the same . And the pattern is reversed among voters in districts where Democratic candidates won : 62 % of Democratic voters in these districts say they are very confident in the vote count in their community ; 48 % of GOP voters in these places say the same .
Lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) people generally see less social acceptance of transgender Americans than for lesbians , gay men and bisexuals in the country , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2013 . Among all LGBT respondents , eight-in-ten say there is only a little ( 59 % ) or no ( 21 % ) social acceptance for transgender people in society , while far fewer say there is little to no acceptance for gay men ( 27 % ) , lesbians ( 14 % ) or bisexual women ( 21 % ) or men ( 46 % ) . The 2013 Pew Research Center survey also found that LGBT adults are less religious than the general public in the U.S. And large majorities of LGBT Americans say that certain religious institutions – particularly Islam ( 84 % ) , the Mormon church ( 83 % ) , the Catholic Church ( 79 % ) and evangelical churches ( 73 % ) – are unfriendly toward people like them . LGBT adults have more mixed views of the Jewish religion and mainline Protestant churches , with 47 % and 44 % of LGBT adults , respectively , describing those religions as unfriendly , one-in-ten describing each of them as friendly and the rest saying they are neutral .
There are transatlantic differences about defense spending . Successive American presidents have called on NATO allies to spend more on security , and Trump has repeatedly pressed the issue . As our 2017 poll shows , there are significant differences between Americans and Germans on this topic , as well as significant partisan differences within the U.S. A plurality of Americans ( 45 % ) say the country 's allies in Europe should spend more on their national defense , while 37 % say spending levels should stay about the same and only 9 % think they should be decreased . But there is a wide partisan gap on this issue , with 63 % of Republicans calling for more spending from allies , compared with just 33 % of Democrats . When Germans were asked about their own defense spending , only 32 % of Germans want to see it increased ; roughly half say it should stay where it is , while 13 % want it cut .
About half of Americans ( 54 % ) say the budget deficit is a very serious problem for the country right now ; 35 % say it is a somewhat serious problem , while 10 % say it is a not too or not at all serious problem right now . While this is similar to public opinion on this question in CBS News/New York Times surveys conducted in 2003 , 2004 and 2005 , far greater shares of Americans said the budget deficit was a serious problem for the country in 2010 and 2011 . For example , in June 2011 , 75 % said the deficit was a very serious problem . Concern about the deficit is lower than it was in 2010 and 2011 across the political spectrum . The share of Republicans , Democrats and independents saying the budget deficit is a very serious problem is down roughly 20 percentage points among each group from surveys conducted in those years .
In another sign of voter discontent , large numbers of the supporters of both Trump and Clinton view their choice as more of a vote against the opposing candidate than an expression of support for their candidate . More than half of Trump supporters ( 55 % ) view their vote more as a vote against Clinton , while just 41 % view it more as a vote for Trump . Among GOP candidates since 2000 , only Mitt Romney has drawn as much negative support ( 58 % of Romney supporters saw their vote more as a vote against Barack Obama ) . Clinton 's supporters are divided – 48 % view their vote more as a vote for their own candidate , while 50 % say it is more a vote against Trump . But that is the highest share of a Democratic candidate 's supporters viewing their choice as more a vote `` against '' the opposing candidate dating back to 2000 . In 2008 , just a quarter of Obama 's supporters said their vote was more a vote against John McCain than a vote for Obama .
Among people with partners , many more bisexual adults are married or in a relationship with someone of the opposite sex than are with someone of the same sex – 88 % say this . This is likely due at least in part to the fact that LGB adults make up a small share of the overall adult population , so the pool of potential same-sex partners is much smaller than the pool of opposite-sex partners . Meanwhile , all the respondents in the survey who identified as straight were in opposite-sex relationships , and nearly all ( 94 % ) of those who identified as gay or lesbian were in same-sex relationships .
Users frequently contribute to crowdfunding projects as a way to help individuals in need . Fully 68 % of crowdfunding donors have contributed to a project to help someone facing some sort of hardship or financial challenge , making it the most common type of project of the five evaluated in this survey . In addition to these types of projects : Contributions to help someone in need are more often directed toward a person who is already known by the donor , as opposed to a stranger or a public figure . Among those who have contributed to a crowdsourced project to help someone in need , 63 % say they have given to help a friend of a friend or an acquaintance , while 62 % have contributed to help a close friend or member of their family . By contrast , just 7 % of these donors have given to a campaign to assist a public figure , while 28 % have given to help someone who was not a public figure but whom they did not know personally .
Overall , 46 % of registered voters say that life in America today is worse than it was 50 years ago `` for people like them , '' while 34 % say life is better and 14 % think it is about the same . Republican and Republican-leaning voters are more than twice as likely as Democratic voters to say life in this country has gotten worse over the past half-century for people like them ( 66 % to 28 % ) . Among GOP voters , fully 75 % of those who support Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination say life for people like them has gotten worse , compared with 63 % of Ted Cruz supporters and 54 % of those who back John Kasich . While Democratic voters generally express more positive views of how life in the U.S. has changed over the past 50 years , those who favor Bernie Sanders are more negative ( 34 % say life has gotten worse ) than those who support Hillary Clinton ( 22 % ) .
Europe 's economy has lagged the U.S. for the past few years . In 2013 , for example , U.S. real gross domestic product grew 2.2 % — not especially strong , but nearly Schwarzeneggerian compared with the 0.1 % real GDP growth managed by the European Union . And while U.S. growth accelerated to a 4.6 % annualized rate in the second quarter ( the first read on third-quarter GDP is due out Oct. 30 ) , EU growth remains anemic : Earlier this month , the International Monetary Fund projected that the advanced European economies would grow just 1.3 % this year , versus 2.2 % for the U.S .
Overall , a number of influential powers in the Middle East are not seen in a favorable light . Roughly one-third or fewer view Russia ( median of 35 % ) or the U.S. ( median of 27 % ) positively . Within the region , views of Iran are particularly poor ( 14 % favorable ) , though Saudi Arabia fares better ( 44 % ) . Middle Eastern and North African publics also tend to rate leaders of other countries in their region negatively . A median of roughly one-third have positive opinions of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Saudi King Salman . Views of Jordanian King Abdullah II are similarly low . And very few view Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu favorably , while a median of 12 % have a positive view of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or Iranian President Hassan Rouhani . Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is the exception to the generally negative views , but opinion of him is still mixed .
Education is linked to views on a variety of science issues , including the safety of genetically modified foods and nuclear power . A majority ( 57 % ) of Americans with a postgraduate degree consider genetically modified foods safe to eat , while 62 % of Americans with a high school degree or less say they are generally unsafe .
As Turkey prepares to vote for its first ever directly elected president , a new Pew Research Center survey finds the Turkish public is divided over the main contender for the office , current Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan . But on a number of issues , Turks are almost evenly split between those who are happy with Erdogan 's leadership and the state of the nation , and those who believe the former Istanbul mayor is leading the country down the wrong path . Overall , 44 % are satisfied with the country 's direction , while 51 % are dissatisfied . Half say the economy is doing well , while 46 % think it is in bad shape . Forty-eight percent say Erdogan is having a good influence on the country ; the same percentage believes he is having a negative impact .
Roughly half of the public ( 49 % ) very closely followed news about Ebola last week , a far greater share than interest in news about ISIS airstrikes ( 29 % ) , U.S. economic news ( 26 % ) and the upcoming congressional elections ( 16 % ) . Overall , last week 's Ebola interest ranks it near the top of the year 's closely followed stories .
Given that , as of 2010 , only about a quarter ( 24 % ) of the global Catholic population is from Europe , the continent remains heavily overrepresented among voting cardinals . By this measure , the most underrepresented continent within the church 's leadership – even with Francis ' new picks – is Latin America and the Caribbean , which is home to 39 % of the worldwide Catholic population ( again , as of 2010 ) and has 19 % of the cardinals .
Younger Americans have long been less likely to read newspapers than their elders . But a Pew Research Center survey has revealed a significant twist , at least for certain newspapers with a more national focus : When we asked people if they regularly got news about the 2016 presidential election through either the print or online version of four specific U.S. newspapers , three of these papers – The New York Times , The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal – attracted more adults younger than 50 than 50 and older as regular readers . As for the fourth – USA Today – younger and older Americans regularly got election news there at about the same rate . Both The New York Times and The Washington Post were regular election news sources for about two-in-ten adults ages 18 - 29 and 30 - 49 , roughly twice the rate of older age groups . For The Wall Street Journal , 15 % of 18- to 29-year-olds and 12 % of 30- to 49-year-olds regularly got election news there , higher than those ages 65 and older ( 7 % ) , but about on par with 50- to 64-year-olds ( 8 % ) . All age groups were about equally likely to get election news from USA Today . Compared with these nationally focused newspapers , a very different picture emerges for local daily papers , of which there are more than a thousand in the U.S. About four-in-ten ( 43 % ) of those ages 65 and older regularly got news about the election from their local daily paper , which is around twice that of those 50 - 64 ( 24 % ) , and three or more times that of those younger ( 13 % of 30- to 49-year-olds and 10 % of those ages 18 - 29 ) . In fact , for adults younger than 50 , local daily papers were lower than or on par with any of the four national brands asked about , whereas for people 50 and older , local daily papers exceeded each of the national brands at least twofold .
The public holds very different views of three world leaders : Vladimir Putin , Benjamin Netanyahu and Angela Merkel . By 69 % to 19 % more hold an unfavorable than favorable view of Russian President Vladimir Putin ; just 13 % do not offer a rating of him . Views of Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are mixed : 34 % view him favorably , while about as many ( 32 % ) view him unfavorably and 33 % are unable to offer a rating . German Chancellor Angela Merkel is not well known to the public : 48 % do not offer a rating of her ; 29 % view her favorably , while 23 % view her unfavorably . Nearly eight-in-ten ( 79 % ) Democrats and Democratic leaners hold an unfavorable view of Putin , compared with a smaller majority of Republicans and Republican leaners ( 61 % ) . Over the last two years , favorable ratings of Putin have increased among Republicans , while unfavorable ratings of him have gone up among Democrats . ( For more , see : `` U.S. public sees Russian role in campaign hacking , but is divided over new sanctions , '' released Jan. 10 , 2017 ) .
The new survey by Pew Research Center , conducted July 22-August 4 among 4,175 adults , also finds little support for overturning Roe v. Wade , the landmark Supreme Court decision that established a woman 's right to an abortion . Seven-in-ten say they do not want to see the Roe v. Wade decision completely overturned ; 28 % say they would like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn the 1973 decision .
Sen. Rand Paul also has a very positive image ( 55 % favorable ) , as does Sen. Marco Rubio ( 50 % ) . Sen. Ted Cruz is not as well known as other GOP figures , but his image is quite positive among those who are familiar with him , particularly among those who identify with the Tea Party .
The survey also shows that roughly eight-in-ten evangelical Protestants ( 79 % ) have a favorable view of the Israeli people , as do seven-in-ten mainline Protestants and about two-thirds of Catholics . People in all three groups are far more likely to say they have a favorable view of the Israeli people than they are to say the same of the Palestinian people . By contrast , religiously unaffiliated people and those in the historically black Protestant tradition are more ambivalent toward Israelis . Those in both of these groups feel about as warmly toward the Palestinian people as they do toward the Israeli people . ( The survey did not include enough interviews with Jews to analyze their views on these questions , because the questions were only asked of half the sample . ) Among all the religious groups analyzed in the survey , the Israeli and Palestinian governments are rated less favorably than the Israeli and Palestinian people . Still , the survey finds the same basic patterns : Evangelicals , mainline Protestants and Catholics are each much more favorably inclined toward the Israeli government than the Palestinian government , while religious `` nones '' and those in the historically black Protestant tradition view the two governments similarly .
Over the past two months , the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has had a devastating impact on nearly all aspects of life in the United States . And now , most Americans expect it will disrupt the presidential election in November . With just over six months until Election Day , two-thirds of Americans ( 67 % ) – including 80 % of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents and half of Republicans and Republican leaners – say it is very or somewhat likely that the coronavirus outbreak will significantly disrupt people 's ability to vote in the presidential election .
According to the Pew Hispanic survey , nearly half ( 48 % ) of all Latinos say they have seen or heard something recently from an organization encouraging them to fill out their census form . But here again , there is a significant difference between the foreign born and the native born in the share who report having seen or heard such messages—56 % versus 38 % .
While texting , talking , emailing and going online dominate , a majority of Americans also use their smartphones for social networking , taking photos or videos , and catching up with the news . A vast majority of smartphone owners say they used their phone for text messaging , voice and video calling , email and accessing the internet at least once over a weeklong `` experience sampling '' study . Besides these four activities , other smartphone apps were also popular . Three-quarters of smartphone owners reported using their phone for social media , while 60 % took pictures or a video , and more than half ( 55 % ) got news on their smartphone at least once over the course of the one-week survey period .
In 2017 , 21 women serve in the U.S. Senate and 83 serve in the House of Representatives , comprising 19.4 % of Congress . While this share is nearly nine times higher than it was in 1965 , it remains well below the 51.4 % of women in the overall U.S. adult population . ( An additional five women serve as nonvoting delegates in the House , representing American Samoa , the District of Columbia , Guam , Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands . )
First , they are the only generation to have recovered the home equity they lost in the downturn . The typical home equity level of Gen X homeowners has doubled since 2010 , though this was not achieved without considerable borrower distress . According to Federal Reserve data , 15 % of Gen X 's homeowners were `` underwater '' on their homes in 2010 ( meaning they owed more than they owned ) . By 2016 only 3 % were underwater . This improvement is due to lenders foreclosing on homeowners as well as appreciating home values and mortgage modifications . Still , reducing the ranks of homeowners with negative equity in their homes boosts wealth .
The number of registered vehicles per person peaked in 2006 , according to the analysis . The number of vehicles per licensed driver peaked in 2001 , 2005 and 2006 . See fewer cars parked in driveways these days ? Vehicles per household peaked in 2001 , 2005 and 2006 .
The new survey finds that while large majorities of voters think that the elections in their community will be run and administered very or somewhat well , they are less confident in the administration of elections throughout the country . And voters ' confidence in elections in the United States has declined since 2018 – with most of the change coming among voters who supported Republican candidates then and Trump today . Currently , 90 % of registered voters say they are very ( 44 % ) or somewhat confident ( 46 % ) that elections in their community will be run and administered very or somewhat well . But a smaller majority ( 62 % ) expects that elections in the U.S. will be administered well . Voters were more positive in views of election administration shortly before the 2018 midterm elections . In October 2018 , about nine-in-ten said they expected elections in their community ( 92 % ) and in the U.S. ( 81 % ) to be run and administered very or somewhat well .
Israelis and Palestinians also differ on views of Obama . About six-in-ten ( 61 % ) Israelis express confidence in the American president to do the right thing regarding world affairs , up from 49 % in 2011 . In the Palestinian territories , just 15 % have confidence in Obama , while 82 % have little or no confidence in him . In Israel , opinions of Obama are far more positive among Jews than among Arabs . More than six-in-ten ( 64 % ) Jews express confidence in the American president , compared with about half ( 48 % ) of Arabs .
Americans are supportive of the space program and space exploration . In a 2011 Pew Research survey , 58 % of Americans said it is essential that the U.S. be a world leader in space exploration .
Of these three issues , Americans are most in agreement when it comes to military drones that target extremists in Pakistan and elsewhere . Among those we surveyed about these anti-terrorism policies , half say the policy has made the U.S. safer . Just 14 % believe drones have made the U.S. less safe and 27 % say they have not made a difference .
Across all levels of federal courts , 44 % of currently active federal judges were appointed by Obama , 30 % by George W. Bush and 14 % by Bill Clinton . Just 6 % of active judges were appointed by Trump . But that figure is certain to rise as the Senate confirms more of his nominees – and as more judges appointed by earlier presidents retire .
Young adults – those younger than 35 – continue to be the most likely of all age groups to rent . In 2016 , 65 % of households headed by people younger than 35 were renting , up from 57 % in 2006 . Rental rates have also risen notably among those ages 35 to 44 . In 2016 , about four-in-ten ( 41 % ) households headed by someone in this age range were renting , up from 31 % in 2006 .
Those who perceived at least some effect of climate change in their local community were asked to consider if climate change has had a personal impact in their lives . Overall , about three-in-ten U.S. adults ( 31 % ) say the local effects are directly affecting their personal lives .
Seven-in-ten Democrats ( 70 % ) and 65 % of independents regard the economic system as unfair . Republicans are divided : 49 % say the system unfairly favors powerful interests , while 47 % say it is fair to most Americans . Majorities across income categories view the system as unfair . Most Americans say it is still possible to get ahead , despite the perceived unfairness of the economic system . Nearly two-thirds ( 64 % ) say `` most people who want to get ahead can make it if they 're willing to work hard . '' A third ( 33 % ) says that `` hard work and determination are no guarantee of success for most people . ''
Despite the overall sentiment in the U.S. that favors a stronger relationship with Germany , younger Americans are more divided . About four-in-ten of those ages 18 to 29 say it is more important to have a close relationship with Germany , compared with 47 % who say the same about China . Older Americans are much more likely to prefer Germany over China . In general , various Pew Research Center surveys have shown older people in the U.S. , Germany and elsewhere across advanced economies have more negative views of China .
Aside from being asked about their generational identity , respondents also were asked how well each generational term applies . In this case , the differences between Boomers and the other three generations are even starker . Seven-in-ten Boomers ( 70 % ) say the term `` Baby-Boom generation '' applies to them very well ( 31 % ) or fairly well ( 39 % ) . Among other generations , no more than about four-in-ten ( 38 % of Gen X ) say their generational label is a good fit .
Pew Research Center surveys of Hispanics and Asian Americans – the groups that comprise the bulk of the modern immigration wave – find that 61 % of adults in the second generation consider themselves to be a `` typical American . '' That 's roughly double the share of their immigrant forebears who say the same .
A majority of Americans ( 54 % ) disapprove of the U.S. government 's collection of telephone and internet data as part of anti-terrorism efforts , while 42 % approve of the program . Democrats are divided on the program , while Republicans and independents are more likely to disapprove than approve , according to a survey we conducted in spring 2014 .
Over half ( 54 % ) of the Americans who are most likely to sign up for health coverage through the new health care exchanges —the uninsured and those who buy their own coverage — would opt for a plan that costs less even if the coverage is narrower , according to a new Kaiser Health Tracking poll released today . Broader plans at a higher cost would be the choice of 34 % . The public , taken as a whole , leans the other way , with 51 % saying they prefer a plan that costs more money but provides a broader network of providers while 37 % would choose a lower-cost option with less choice . Americans who have employer-provided coverage prefer higher-cost/broader network plans by an even larger margin : 55 % to 34 % . But Kaiser found some wiggle room in the opinions of those in the higher or lower cost camps . When the 37 % of the overall public who said they preferred the lower cost plans were asked if they would still feel the same if they found out they would not be able to visit the doctors or hospitals they usually use , the percentage saying they would stick with that option fell to 23 % . On the flip side of the question , when the Americans who said they preferred the more expensive , broader plans were told they could save about 25 % on health care costs by going for narrower plans , the share of those choosing the more costly option dropped from 51 % to 37 % .
Excluding leaners , however , conservative Republicans ' share of the overall electorate has been more or less steady since 2004 , according to Pew Research analysis of national exit poll data : About a fifth of voters identified as conservative Republicans in 2012 . ( Liberal Democrats made up 16 % of the electorate in 2012 , continuing a modest but steady increase since 2000 . )
Discontentment among Argentines extends across a wide range of conditions in the country . Overall , 72 % of Argentines say they are pessimistic with how the political system works when thinking about the future . Those with a favorable view of the ruling party are less likely to feel pessimistic about the way their political system works than those with an unfavorable view ( 58 % vs. 78 % ) , though majorities of both are still pessimistic . Roughly half of the Argentine public reports feeling pessimistic about the possibility of reducing the gap between the rich and poor ( 52 % ) , the nation 's education system ( 52 % ) and the availability of well-paying jobs ( 51 % ) . On a positive note , a majority of Argentines express optimism about their country 's culture when looking ahead ( 61 % ) .
Republicans ' views of Mueller 's investigation , which were generally negative over the probe 's two-year course , are much more positive now that it has been completed . Six-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning independents now say they are confident in the fairness of the investigation . In January , just 39 % of Republicans said they were confident Mueller was conducting a fair inquiry .
When asked about the Islamist group Boko Haram , roughly eight-in-ten Nigerian Muslims ( 83 % ) say they have an unfavorable opinion of the extremist movement . Even more Nigerian Christians ( 92 % ) say the same .
Barack Obama 's overall approval ratings have been stable over the course of 2015 . Currently about as many say they approve of the way Barack Obama is handling his job as president as say they disapprove of his job performance ( 46 % vs. 48 % ) . But on several other key policy areas , there is more disapproval than approval of Obama 's performance . Ratings of Obama 's performance on the economy remain relatively unchanged over the past year : 52 % disapprove , while 43 % approve .
Meanwhile , the millions of Millennials who have entered into parenthood are notably confident in their parenting abilities . In the 2015 survey , half of Millennial parents ( 52 % ) said they were doing a very good job as a parent , compared with 43 % of Gen X parents and 41 % of Boomer parents . Millennial moms , in particular , were more likely than other moms ( or dads ) to say they were doing a very good job : 57 % said this , compared with 48 % of Gen X moms and 41 % of Boomer moms . Millennial dads , like other fathers , did n't rate themselves as highly as moms on this measure – 43 % said they were doing a very good job . By comparison , 37 % of Gen X dads said the same , as did 39 % of all dads . ( The differences among dads are not statistically significant . )
Trump viewed as candidate of ‘ change , ' not necessarily for the better . Fully 77 % of voters say Trump would change the way things work in Washington , compared with just 45 % who say the same about Clinton . But more voters say Trump would change things for the worse than for the better ( 44 % vs. 33 % ) . A quarter of voters say Clinton would change Washington for the worse , while 20 % say she would change things for the better .
Many adults also report being the target of some form of abusive behavior online . Some 41 % of adults have experienced some form of online harassment , as measured in a 2017 survey .
2 ) App response rates were lower than Web rates overall and for each of the 14 surveys we conducted . When conducting a new poll , survey researchers often go to a lot of trouble to find out how many of the people they targeted to take the survey actually end up completing the questionnaire , a concept referred to as the response rate . In this case , we found that those who were asked to take the survey on a Web browser were more likely to complete at least one survey than those using apps to take the survey , resulting in overall response rates of 84 % and 58 % , respectively . Part of this may be due to the fact that many panelists assigned to use the app had trouble using it because they did n't know what an app was , how to download it or how to use it even though they own a smartphone . In the future , we will take this into consideration because if fewer people use the survey app , this has implications for both the precision of the data collected and for cost . 3 ) App and Web respondents look similar demographically , and their answers basically did not differ . App respondents were somewhat younger , more likely to be from the Midwest and less likely to be registered to vote than Web respondents . Overall , app respondents looked slightly more like all smartphone users than did the Web respondents . In the final reckoning , though , both the app and Web respondents look similar enough in terms of demographics that either could be used to represent all smartphone users .
Americans are divided over whose responsibility it is to take care of displaced workers in the event of far-reaching job automation . Half of U.S. adults said that in the event that robots and computers are capable of doing many human jobs , it is the government 's obligation to take care of displaced workers , even if it means raising taxes substantially , according to the 2017 survey . A nearly identical share ( 49 % ) said that obligation should fall on the individual , even if machines have already taken many human jobs .
Like Americans overall , Catholics are divided by party on the question of whether abortion should be legal . Most Catholics who identify as Republican or lean toward the Republican Party ( 63 % ) said abortion should be illegal in all or most cases , while an even larger share of Catholics who identify as Democrats or lean that way ( 77 % ) said abortion should be legal in all or most cases , the 2019 survey showed . Still , roughly one-third of Catholic Republicans ( 36 % ) favored legal abortion , while 17 % of Catholic Democrats opposed it , reflecting some dissent within both parties on this issue .
Americans and Russians strongly disagree over whether the U.S. takes into account other countries ' interests when it makes foreign policy . A majority of Americans ( 57 % ) say Washington does consider other nations , but nearly two-thirds of Russians ( 65 % ) say it does not . This sentiment in Russia has been consistent since the question was first posed in 2002 . Similarly , most Americans since then have also said the U.S. listens to other countries when making foreign policy . In 2002 , however , 75 % of Americans said this was the case , compared with 57 % seen today .
Between paid and unpaid work , the average mother works about 2 more hours a week than she did in 1965 , though the mix of time spent on paid work , housework and child care has changed dramatically :
All citizen panelists – whether voters or nonvoters – were asked which U.S. House candidate they supported in the general election . Nonvoters tend to express more uncertainty about the choice , owing in large part to the fact that many of them pay little attention to politics . But among those who did express a preference , Democratic candidates led Republican candidates by 14 percentage points ( 44 % to 30 % ) a larger margin than among voters ( 9 points , 53 % to 44 % ) .
Vote choices are strongly related to voters ' underlying political attitudes and values , as evidenced by the fact that ideologically consistent voters are nearly uniformly supportive of the candidates of their respective political parties . Among likely voters who are consistent conservatives , 97 % say they will vote for the Republican candidate for U.S. House in their district ; 91 % of those with mostly conservative opinions will also do so . Among those with consistently liberal views , 94 % say they will vote Democratic , followed by 84 % among those with mostly liberal views .
The coronavirus outbreak has impacted life for millions of Americans , but it has not affected people in the same way . Older Americans are more likely than younger adults to feel their own health is at risk , while younger people are more focused on potential economic threats . The survey , conducted March 19 - 24 , finds that a quarter of adults say the coronavirus outbreak is a major threat to their personal health and finances . About as many ( 24 % ) say it is a major threat to their finances , but not to their health . Fewer Americans ( 11 % ) view the outbreak as a major threat to their health , but not their finances . However , 40 % say it is not a major threat either to their health or their finances . Compared with older age groups , younger Americans are more likely to say that the COVID-19 outbreak is a major threat to their personal financial situation but not a major threat to their personal health .
This survey by the Pew Research Center 's Internet Project was underwritten by Carnegie Mellon University . The findings in this report are based on data from telephone interviews conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International from July 11 - 14 , among a sample of 1,002 adults ages 18 and older . Telephone interviews were conducted in English by landline and cell phone . For results based on the total sample , one can say with 95 % confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points and for the results from 792 internet and smartphone users in the sample , the margin of error is 3.8 percentage points . More information is available in the Methods section at the end of this report . Beyond their general hope that they can go online anonymously , the majority of internet users have tried to avoid observation by other people , groups , companies , and government agencies . Hackers , criminals and advertisers are at the top of the list of groups people wish to avoid .
The number of Hispanics who speak Spanish at home is at an all-time high , though growth is slowing . A record 37 million Hispanics ages 5 and older speak Spanish at home , up from 25 million in 2000 . However , between 2010 and 2015 , this number grew at an annual average of 1.8 % , down from an annual average of 3.4 % between 2000 and 2010 . California continues to have the largest Latino population among states , but Texas is seeing a faster growth rate . In 2015 , 15.2 million Hispanics lived in California , a 39 % increase from 10.9 million in 2000 . Yet Texas has had even faster growth , with its Hispanic population increasing 60 % over the same period , from 6.7 million in 2000 to 10.7 million in 2015 . Meanwhile , Georgia 's Hispanic population has more than doubled since 2000 , the fastest growth among the 10 states with the largest Hispanic populations .
Awareness of last year 's riots in France is relatively high among both the general publics and Muslim minorities in Western Europe , ranging among the general population from 91 % in Germany to 78 % in Spain and among Muslims from 86 % in Germany to 63 % in Britain .
