World of Warcraft - additional information World of Warcraft is an immensely popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game, also known as MMORPG, developed and published by video game developer Blizzard Entertainment in 2004. In the third quarter of 2015, the game had a total of 5.5 million subscribers, however as of that time the developer chose not to disclose subscriber figures any more. Still, other metrics indicate the game does not lack in popularity, as its expansion packs sell millions of copies within 24 hours of their release. There are a total of 14 playable races in the game. World of Warcraft servers are divided into different ‘’realms’’ based on the continent of the player. The distribution of World of Warcraft characters in the U.S. and EU realms is very similar. As of 2019, humans were the most popular race, having been chosen by a total of 14.4 percent of all U.S. realm players, while accounting for 15 percent of the entire EU realm population. The largest percentage difference between the U.S. and EU realms with regards to the choice of race was with the Blood Elves. Approximately 16.2 percent of all U.S. realm players chose the Blood Elf as their character, while only 15.2 percent made the same choice in EU realms.

While this improvement has been welcomed, black males remained twice as likely to be the victim of a gun related death compared with white males. This inequality has lead to a rise in political action and demonstration around what is perceived as inaction or ignorance over the issue by government and wider society. The high profile death of Trayvon Martin in Florida followed by the deaths at the hand of police Freddie Gray and Michael Brown served as the catalyst for such movements. The wider issue of violence beyond murder also appears to have systemic correlations.

U.S.-based Nike is the world’s leading brand in athletic footwear and apparel, and the most valuable sports business brand in the world. Nike has a higher global revenue than its main competitors, Adidas and Puma, put together. North America is a key market for Nike, as almost half of its global revenue was generated there in 2018, mainly from footwear sales. Much of Nike's success can be attributed to the brand’s marketing campaign as well as sponsorship agreements with celebrity athletes and professional sports teams. Adidas and Puma used to be one company named Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik, established by two brothers, Adolf and Rudolf Dassler. After a disagreement between the two brothers, the company split, creating the two widely known sporting brands, Adidas and Puma. Adidas is the largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe, and the second largest in the world, just behind Nike, with over 21 billion euros in annual revenue and a brand value of approximately 16.7 billion U.S. dollars. Adidas employed 56,888 people worldwide in 2017. Just as with Nike, footwear is the most important category for Adidas. In 2018, over 50 percent of the Adidas Group net sales were generated by the footwear category.

Pro-life supporters, which made up 49 percent as well in the same year, on the other hand, oppose abortion altogether. Abortion in the United States Abortion and the question whether one is pro-life (and thus against abortion) or pro-choice (i.e. in favor of abortion) is a controversial topic in the United States and the subject of many heated discussions. Before the notorious “Roe vs. Wade” decision of the Supreme Court in 1973, abortion was illegal in most U.S. states and only legal under certain circumstances in others. In short, the case “Roe vs. Wade” was a milestone in granting women freedom over their own body, making abortion legal, as it ruled that a woman’s right to privacy included her unborn child, and set regulations for the availability of abortions. Ever since this decision, there have been two main mindsets (with many variations) when it comes to abortion. One is the pro-life attitude, which deems abortion murder and considers life starting at conception. The other is the pro-choice movement, which focuses on the well-being of the mother and insists that the woman alone should decide whether she wants to keep a baby or not. Politically, pro-lifers are usually seen as conservative, often belonging to the Republican camp, while pro-choicers are usually regarded as liberals who lean towards the Democrats. Of course, exceptions are not uncommon. Morally speaking, the majority of Americans still think abortion is wrong , However, the pro-choicers seem to have taken the lead over the pro-lifers in recent years, as can be seen above.

In contrast to that, in the same year, only 3.1 percent of the household income are earned by the lowest quintile. This relation between the quintiles illustrates the income inequality in the United States. Income inequality Income inequality is a big topic for public discussion in the United States. About 65 percent of U.S. Americans think that the gap between the rich and the poor has gotten larger in the past ten years.

The Gini coefficient for individual earnings of full-time, year round workers has increased between 1990 and 2018 from 0.36 to 0.42, for example.

Like four years previous, Norwegians had to dig deeper into their pockets than any of their European neighbors, with prices roughly 20,000 euros higher than the EU-28 average. Reasons for automobiles being so costly in Norway are partly due to higher tax rates than in most other European countries. A VAT of 25 percent is imposed on all new and used passenger vehicles imported into the country, while registration tax on cars considers weight, CO2 and NOx emissions of the car. These incentives contribute to making larger, heavier vehicles using petrol and diesel engines more expensive than anywhere else in Europe. The only vehicles exempt from VAT and tolls were electric cars. Car tax rates in Nordic countries higher on average Other European countries with a 25 percent tax rate on acquisition are Croatia, Denmark and Sweden, while those in Hungary even exceeded Norwegian rates by two percent. As seen in this statistic higher tax rates on passenger cars translates to higher prices overall. Sweden and Denmark both appeared in the top seven most expensive car buying countries.

In India, the situation was entirely different. The second most populous country in the world displayed a literacy rate of merely 75 percent in 2006. The dramatic increase in literacy in China has a lot to do with the efficacy of numerous political, economic and educational policies. In 1982, compulsory education was written into the Chinese constitution, postulating a nine-year compulsory education funded by the government. As is shown by the graph above, there was a large gender gap in literacy rate in China as of 1982. Though this gap still existed in 2010, it was narrowed down to 5.7 percent, starting from 28 percent in 1982. Since 1990, the national education policy was directed at females, especially from poor and/or minority families. Over the past years, China has achieved gender parity in primary schooling. However, regional literacy disparities in China should not to be overlooked. Regions with a strong economic background tend to display illiteracy rates below national average. In contrast, economically underdeveloped regions have a much larger share of people who cannot read nor write. Tibet for instance, a region where 92 percent of the population belong to an ethnic minority, showed the highest illiterate rate nationwide, with almost 35 percent in 2012.

While the economy continues to grow, prices, cost of living, and wages keep on increasing as well. How do wages differ across the country? China’s provinces and cities are divided into districts of different levels. Most provinces set different minimum wages for different districts depending on the cost of living and level of development. Usually, provincial capitals and major cities enjoy higher hourly wages than smaller towns and rural areas of the same province. In 2018, the highest minimum hourly wages in China were in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin municipalities with 24, 21, and 20.8 yuan respectively, whereas employees in Hunan and Yunnan provinces who received a minimum wage were paid the least – between 11.6 and 15 yuan per hour. Minimum monthly wages that year were the highest in Shanghai and the lowest in Chongqing. The average annual salary in urban China was around 74,300 yuan in 2017. What are the prospects? Regional governments in China must update their minimum wages at least every few years. Fujian, Hunan, Gansu, Guizhou, Tianjin, Qinghai, and Zhejiang – provinces and municipalities that have not adjusted minimum wages in the past two years – are likely to do so in 2019.

While military aircraft manufacturing is likely to see a decline in revenue in the near future, commercial aircraft production is forecast to further expand its market size. Growth is projected to be largely driven by orders from commercial airlines that are keen to meet increased passenger travel demand. The rising number of commercial airline passengers is closely intertwined with the growing affluence in emerging markets.

GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year. It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country. Real GDP is adjusted for price changes and is therefore regarded as a key indicator for economic growth. In 2018, the GDP in the European Union increased by about 2.2 percent compared to the previous year. Growth trends in the EU compared to the euro area The euro area, which is also called the eurozone, is an economic and monetary union (EMU) which includes 19 of the 28 European Union member states which have formally adopted the euro. Those countries include Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. Member states which have not yet adopted the euro include Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Additionally, there is the so-called Schengen Area, which is composed of EU and non-EU states, and has been established mainly to facilitate travelling in Europe. While some countries, such as Kosovo and Montenegro have adopted the euro unilaterally, they are not formally part of the eurozone. Others have established a monetary agreement with the EU to use the euro, such as Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican, but they do not form part of the official euro area. As can be seen in the chart, annual GDP growth slumped in 2012 and 2013, presumably as a result of the global financial crisis, in both the EU and the euro area. In 2013, growth began increasing ever so slightly and in 2014 the EU regained a bit of stability. However, overall recovery in the EU has been relatively moderate and gradual; growth throughout the EU has been slightly better than in the euro area and is projected to remain slightly better for the foreseeable future. Relatively new member states such as Romania and the Czech Republic, which have not yet adopted the euro, reported the highest annual growth rates in the EU in 2015, and generally, new member states show slightly better growth rates. Also, unemployment has been slightly higher in the euro area compared to the EU for the last ten years (267906). The unemployment rate also remains relatively high for both the EU and the euro area. As for public spending as a share of GDP, these figures are slightly higher in the euro area than in the EU as a whole. The member states with the highest national debt include the United Kingdom, Italy, France and Germany - some of the oldest members of the euro area. The national debt of the euro area is slightly higher than the national debt of the EU as a whole, underlining the economic situation of both areas.

The most-believed superstition is that finding a penny brings good luck; approximately one third of Americans believe in this. The second most-believed superstition is that seeing the groom before a wedding is bad luck; close to a quarter of the Americans agreed. In contrast, only seven percent of Americans believe that stepping on a crack is bad luck.

In 2030, the price of natural gas in Europe is expected to reach about seven constant U.S. dollars per million British thermal units. Natural gas prices For millions of years, a combination of decayed plants and animals has been trapped beneath sand, silt and rock. Over time, pressure and heat changed some of this organic material into tiny bubbles of odorless gas. Given the fact that the world’s demand for energy is growing at a rapid pace, natural gas is seen by many as a good alternative to other energy sources. It is a more mature technology than most renewable energy sources and is viewed as much more environmentally friendly than coal or nuclear sources. In the transportation sector, natural gas is set to replace petroleum as a fuel in motor vehicles or ships. The combination of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) and horizontal drilling can be regarded as one of the energy industry’s biggest breakthroughs in decades, with the United States being the largest beneficiary.

His total earnings from 1996 to 2014 add up to about 1.37 billion U.S. dollars. Tiger Woods’ golf career - additional information Eldrick (Tiger) Woods, born in California in 1975, is not only one of the most successful professional golf players of all time, but also one of most accomplished athletes worldwide. Throughout his career he has broken a number of records, but he is also credited for having changed the way the sport was both played and perceived by the public. He was consistently named “the youngest” to win a certain title, including the youngest Masters champion ever (at 21) and in a sport dominated by white players, he was the first major championship winner of African or Asian descent. Overall he has won 106 tournaments, out of which four were Masters titles and 79 were on the PGA TOUR. His father first introduced him to golf before the age of two and he made several television appearances as a prodigy player throughout his childhood. Before turning professional at age 20 in August 1996, Woods had an impressive amateur career, which included titles such as Golf Digest Player of the Year in 1991 and 1992, Golf World Player of the Year in 1992 and 1993, Golfweek National Amateur of the Year in 1992 and Golf World Man of the Year in 1994, as well as records such as winning six United States Golf Association national championships and the National Collegiate Athletic Association title. He was also the youngest player ever to win the U.S. Junior Amateur at 15 and the youngest ever to win the U.S. Amateur at 18. As a result of his many wins, Woods has earned hundreds of millions on the course, but has also made very lucrative endorsement deals with major companies off the course, from Gillette to Buick or Gatorade. He most notably started a deal with Nike in 1996, which was famously renewed in 2000 for a reported 105 million U.S. dollars for a period of six years. This contract was renewed again in 2006 and 2013 for undisclosed sums, which contributed to his status as the richest golf player and one of the best paid athletes in the world.

Sponsorship continues to be concentrated on more prestigious and profitable companies while the increases in funding directed at smaller rightsholders are estimated to stay below two percent in most cases. This is because sponsors look to create partnerships with well-established properties that can create incremental value for both parties through efforts such as developing content and creating new products.

The same year, the Australian inflation rate, another important key indicator for its economic situation, amounted to 1.96 percent. Why is the inflation rate important? Inflation is the steady increase in price levels for consumer goods and services during a certain timespan. The European Central Bank considers a steady inflation rate of two percent a year beneficial for a stable economy – otherwise a country risks economic hardship. In the worst case, a country can experience either hyperinflation (like Venezuela), which is the rapid increase of prices to a point of economic collapse, or deflation, which is the decrease of prices and devaluation of money that can also lead to economic collapse. Up and down under Australia’s inflation has been clawing itself out of a slump in 2016, when it unceremoniously dropped to 1.25 percent due to falling petrol costs and oil prices. The following year, it recovered instantaneously and soared back to just under two percent, and forecasts see it reaching 2.52 percent by 2021.

It is dull grey in appearance and metallic in luster. It conducts electricity easily because there are electrons between the layers of carbon atoms. Under high pressures and temperatures, graphite turns into diamonds. This process is actually how synthetic diamonds are produced. Due to its high conductivity, graphite is used in electrodes, batteries, and solar panels. Some other uses include being used in pencils (as it is well known as ‘pencil lead’), and lubricants. Graphite was first used during the Neolithic Age as a paint. Since it was discovered in England around the year 1565, the use of graphite has increased.

Interestingly, Russia is among the leading export countries worldwide and agricultural products, as well as meat, are among the main exported goods. Russia’s economy also profits significantly from selling and exporting fish and sea food. Due to large oil resources, Russia is also among the largest economies and the countries with the largest gross domestic product / GDP worldwide. Subsequently, living and working conditions in Russia should be above average, but for a long time, many Russians have struggled to get by. While conditions seem to improve nowadays, many Russians still live below the poverty line. One suggested reason for this is corruption, which has been cited as a severe problem for the country for a long time, and continues to pose difficulties for Russia’s economy.

These figures also do not include interest payments on the national debt that will result from higher deficits due to war spending. The war in Afghanistan and Iraq The war in Afghanistan is an ongoing conflict that was initiated when the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom in October 7, 2001, in order to remove the Taliban regime from power and to dismantle the Islamic terrorist organization Al-Qaeda. The war was a direct consequence of the terrorist attacks that occurred in the United States on September 11, 2001. The United States and its allies quickly captured major cities and towns in the country and drove the Taliban from power. In December 2001, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was established by the United Nations Security Council, to oversee security in Afghanistan. In 2003 the NATO assumed leadership of ISAF troops. ISAF forces include troops from 43 different countries. After the killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. forces, NATO-member countries endorsed an exit strategy for the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan. Up to today, the Afghan war has resulted in more than 10,000 casualties. The Iraq War was an armed conflict between forces from several countries, led by the United States (named “coalition of the willing”), and the Iraqi government. The conflict was initiated on March 20, 2003, when international forces invaded Iraq and officially ended when in December 18, 2011 the U.S. completed its withdrawal of military personnel. The intention of the invasion was to overthrow the existing regime of the Ba’ath party under President Saddam Hussein, establishing democratic elections and forming a new government.

Attitudes to reality TV in the U.S. Reality TV may make a lot of noise in the news and on social media, but a survey revealed that reality shows were the least popular in the U.S., with respondents preferring comedy, drama and even shows in the horror genre. It was also found that the majority of adults thought there were too many reality shows on air, which is unsurprising given the genre’s low favorability. However, quality of reality shows was considered to be an issue, with most adults saying that the reality TV genre has gotten worse in recent years. Why does it matter who likes reality TV and who doesn’t? On the whole, genre preferences are incredibly subjective, and even those who generally dislike reality TV often find themselves binge-watching shows like ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’, ‘The Voice’ or ‘Big Brother’. However, demand for a genre is often reflected in the types of TV shows and movies available on streaming services. For companies like Netflix, demand and favorability of certain genres is a key factor to take into account when creating original content. Data shows that Netflix largely sidelined the reality genre in its original programming, instead focusing heavily on comedy which has long been one of the most favorable genres among U.S. audiences.

A survey showed that 23 percent of U.S. adults reported spending one hour of more with the bible in each sitting in 2017, compared to 24 percent four years earlier. The Bible: consumption in the United States The frequency of reading the Bible among adults in the U.S. changed very little between 2018 and 2019, however reading habits among survey respondents were at two extremes. Whilst the majority reported never reading the Bible at all, the second largest share of adults said that they read the text every day. Whilst the average time spent with the Bible has only very mildly fluctuated over the last few years, attitudes and consumption habits are changing. Back in 2011, 67 percent of surveyed U.S. adults said that they wished they used the Bible more, however by 2019 this figure had dropped to 56 percent. In addition to this, digital formats have become more prevalent and have proved more appealing to younger readers than to older generations. Print is still by far the most popular format, however more Millennials and Gen-Xers prefer to read the Bible via a smartphone or tablet app than their older peers, and the frequency of reading online versions of the Bible was also higher among younger generations. Whilst to older generations using digital versions of religious or sacred texts may seem strange or even a step too far, clearly a demand for such content exists. The Bible app came second in a ranking of the highest rated iOS apps in the United States with over 97 percent positive user reviews – that’s almost ten percent more than Spotify.

Due to foreign investments in Latin America, high-caliber infrastructure and an increasing volume of exports, Spain’s economy remained at a relatively high standard up to present day. However, the Spanish economy has also experienced its ups and downs, particularly during the late 2000s and early 2010s. The global financial crisis of 2008 was the first step towards the slow collapse of the Spanish economy, which was then followed by the Eurozone crisis, which initially began in 2009. During these years, government spending dramatically exceeded government revenues and as a result, Spain was forced to absorb regularly increasing debt in order to sustain and preserve the state of the government. Unemployment was always a weakness within the Spanish economy, having never really reached economically appropriate standards for a country of its stature.

ERGO was the concern with the highest market share in Belgium’s private health insurance market in this period. What is the insurance market size in Belgium? In 2018, there were 111 insurance companies in Belgium. The biggest insurance branch in Belgium is the ""life"" branch, which focuses on life insurances, pensions and funeral in kind insurances. This is based on the so-called life insurance market share in terms of gross premium, a ratio which measures whether consumers spend more on life insurance or on non-life insurance. This ratio was approximately 76 percent in Belgium in 2005. This, however, decreased to approximately 54 percent in 2017. How does health insurance work in Belgium? In Belgium, all employees and self-employed must register and make contributions to one of five free health insurance funds or “mutualities” (in Dutch: mutualiteit or ziekenfonds, in French: mutuelle). These funds are paid by social benefits and government subsidies, with patients free to choose their own medical professionals and places of treatment. To increase the cover for medical costs, however, Belgian residents can add private supplementary health insurances to their mutuality. For these reasons, Belgium writes less direct premiums for health insurance than the Netherlands (where the contents of basic health insurance are decided by the government but provided and partially funded by private health insurance companies).

However, in most cases, people do not believe that having a tattoo can characterize someone as being spiritual, healthy or rebellious in addition to a number of other characteristics. This may be because tattoos are becoming more and more mainstream, with close to 30 percent of Americans now having one or more tattoos; that means three out of every ten people. Furthermore, body ink is most common among Americans between the ages of 30 and 39, a demographic where more than half have tattoos - i.e. one out of every two people. Another interesting fact is that slightly more women have tattoos than men. It the end, it appears rather difficult to characterize someone with a tattoo, especially when so many people now have them. However, at the same time, it is not always obvious to know who has one or not; it turns out that a vast majority of tattooed Americans hide their tattoos in everyday life, with less than 20 percent having visible ones. However, this too may change as tattooed skin becomes more and more accepted.

The United States, despite its history, has become an openly diverse country, with a multitude of immigrants becoming legal U.S. citizens and gaining rights, most notably from Asia. Based on a recent survey in 2010, it was evident that interracial marriages in the United States were primarily present with Hispanics and Asians.

Virtual reality - additional information A 2015 Statista survey conducted in the United States has asked the question “Have you ever heard of the term 'virtual reality'?” A total of 92 percent of respondents have answered positively, awareness being strongest among 30 to 39 year-olds. “Virtual reality (VR),” also called “virtual environment (VE),”“computer-simulated life” or “immersive multimedia,” is a phenomenon straight out of SF books and films of the last century that is on its way to attaining market maturity. VR can help replicate an environment, whether real or completely imaginary by stimulating all senses: sight and hearing, as well as sometimes touch, smell, or even taste. In order to experience virtual reality, the user needs a number of specific hardware, such as, most importantly, a head-mounted display (HMD) - a wraparound headset which does not allow light or images from the real world to interfere with the virtual one. As of 2015, a number of companies are announcing commercially available HMDs specifically created for VR. These include the Oculus Rift (produced by a Facebook-acquired company – Oculus VR), the HTC Vive (HTC in partnership with Valve Corporation) or Project Morpheus (Sony’s VR headset for the Playstation 4). According to recent forecasts, revenue from virtual reality Head-mounted displays is expected to grow from 685 million U.S. dollars in 2015 to 3.89 billion U.S. dollars in 2018. Other hardware includes data gloves - gloves with attached sensors detecting hand movements, which allow the user to interact with the virtual world and to “touch” objects inside it, as well as wands or even treadmills. It is estimated that, by 2018, over 100 million units of various such input systems will be sold, producing revenues of over 760 million U.S. dollars. The VR industry is growing at a fast pace, with revenues from virtual reality products (both hardware and software) projected to increase from 90 million U.S. dollars in 2014 to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2018.

In 2010, a revenue of 15.71 billion U.S. dollars was generated through gate revenue in North America. Game day revenue in sports Revenue from ticket sales (gate receipts) and other game-day related revenue is an important stream of revenue in sports. Next to revenue from broadcasting and media rights deals and the commercial segment (merchandising, sponsorships etc.) gate revenues bring in a large part of revenue in sports. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that sports gate revenues were at around 40 billion U.S. dollars in 2012, of which around 39 percent (15.86 billion U.S. dollars) is attributable to the North American sports market. The Dallas Cowboys, for example, generated 89 million U.S. dollars in revenue from gate receipts (including club seats) in 2012 according to research by Forbes.

In that election the two largest parties, Labour and Conservative maintained their lead over the smaller parties. This all changed in the first few months of 2019 when support for both main parties declined at an alarming rate. May’s Brexit Deal The sudden decline in support for both main parties seen in early 2019 was undoubtedly caused by the instability of the final months of the May premiership, where she failed to get her Brexit deal through the UK house of Commons three times.

Young drivers are the ones accounting for the highest share of cellphone use fatalities. Another reason why fatal accidents are rising in number is that non-occupants’ exposure to risk is also increasing.

While the fertility rate is much lower now than it has been, in 2013, World Bank figures show a fertility rate of 3 children per woman. This rate is still relatively high, but the country’s historically expanding population has left the country with a large cohort of young people: Almost 40 percent of the Syrian population is under 14 years of age, with close to 60 percent of the population aged 15 to 64. This leaves around a meager 4 percent of Syrians who are over 65 years old.

1255,multiColumn/1255.csv," This statistic shows the approximate cost breakdowns for LED-based luminaires in the United States, by lamp type. Assembly costs accounted for three percent of the total costs associated with outdoor area lamps. About 13 percent of the cost of an outdoor LED area lamp is from the LED package. LED Lighting in the United States A light-emitting diode (LED) is a two-lead semiconductor source of light that emits light based on an electroluminescence effect. Globally, about 13 percent of LED lighting is currently used for automotive purposes and about 12 percent for signage. Different energy band gaps in the semiconductor can determine the color that is emitted by the LED. The first practical LED was created in 1962, which emitted a low-intensity infrared light and is still commonly used today. LEDs are often considered a better alternative to incandescent lights as they consume less energy, last longer, and are more physically robust. In 2007, the U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act banned the use of 100 watt incandescent lights, and in 2012, California abolished the sales of incandescent lights. Today, the United States imports and exports a large volume of LEDs. In 2009, the U.S. imported about 672.6 million U.S. dollars in value of LED lighting. The country primarily imports lights from China, South Korea, Mexico, and Canada. LEDs currently have a higher initial cost than other conventional lighting, but its reduced maintenance cost from extended lifetime provides a longer-term cost savings. For an outdoor area lamp, almost half the cost is associated with the mechanical, thermal, and electrical aspects. About 10.8 percent of LED lamps in the U.S. lamp inventory are dedicated to outdoor lighting. In a typical LED package in the United States, 30 percent of the cost is from packaging and about 23 percent is for the epitaxy. The epitaxy is a technique used to grow additional layers of semiconductor crystals on the surface of the wafer. If defects arise during this process, it can impact the performance, reliability, and yield of the device.

1402,multiColumn/1402.csv," The Rugby Football Union (RFU) is the governing body of rugby union in England. History During the end of the 18th century British public schools, almost exclusively attended by boys from the more affluent upper classes, were governed by strict and often cruel disciplinary action in lessons. In contrast to this, the Masters were almost entirely ambivalent to the activities that took place outside the classroom, the resulting ‘boy culture’ of bullying and brutality quickly became an issue that had to be addressed. In the early 19th century the Headmaster of Rugby School, Dr Thomas Arnold recognized the potential of a group sport activity to occupy the time of the mischievous students whilst simultaneously introducing positive Christian values, in a concept known as ‘muscular Christianity’. The successful use of games as a vehicle for achieving social control in Rugby School lead to a similar application of muscular Christianity across the increasingly expanding number of public schools. Although many schools adopted a form of group competitive activity, the precise rules of the game varied significantly from school to school, and subsequently from club to club, often formed by former public school boy that wished to continue participating in their sport. In the late 19th Century two proponents of the game published a letter in The Times suggesting that ""those who play the rugby-type game should meet to form a code of practice as various clubs play to rules which differ from others, which makes the game difficult to play."" On 26 January 1871 during a meeting attended by representatives from 21 clubs, the RFU was founded. Although similar unions were organized during the next few years in Ireland, Wales, Scotland, New Zealand, Australia, France, Canada, South Africa, and the United States, the RFU was the first and therefore had no need to distinguish itself from others by calling itself the English RFU. The RFU was a founding member of the sport's international governing body, World Rugby in 1887. Objectives The RFU describes its primary objective as to encourage rugby, and its values, to flourish across England: It promotes and runs the sport, organizes international matches for the England national team, and educates and trains players and officials. Income In 2019 the RFU earned approximately 213.2 million British pounds, with the majority of this income is attributed to ticket sales, broadcasting, sponsorship and hospitality and catering. In 2019 the revenue associated with ticket sales was approximately 47.6 million British pounds, an increase of over 17 million British Pounds from the previous year.
