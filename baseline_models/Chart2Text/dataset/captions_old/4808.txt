 On June 14, 2018, Time Warner was acquired by multinational conglomerate AT&T, who subsequently renamed Time Warner ‘WarnerMedia’. AT&T reported WarnerMedia’s global operating income as 9.86 billion U.S. dollars in 2019. Previous figures can be viewed for the purposes of tracking Time Warner’s income but due to being recorded pre-acquisition, cannot be compared to the company’s 2019 income.
