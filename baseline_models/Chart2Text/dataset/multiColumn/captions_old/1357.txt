 Among the 'Best Picture' nominees for the 2020 Academy Awards were 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood', 'Ford v Ferrari', 'Little Women', and '1917', all of which grossed over 100 million U.S. dollars domestically. Other nominees 'The Irishman' and 'Marriage Story' were not included in the ranking as they did not have a traditional theatrical release and as such do not have any box office figures to represent their performance in cinemas.
