At the other end of the spectrum , in France , only 48 % say they use social networking sites . That figure is even lower in Greece ( 46 % ) , Japan ( 43 % ) and Germany ( 37 % ) . In Germany , this means that more than half of internet users say they do not use social media .
When it comes to attitudes about the size and scope of government , people who say the term libertarian describes them well ( and who are able to correctly define the term ) are somewhat more likely than the public overall to say government regulation of business does more harm than good ( 56 % vs. 47 % ) . However , about four-in-ten libertarians say that government regulation of business is necessary to protect the public interest ( 41 % ) .
The share of Americans with an unfavorable view of China reached a 14-year high amid a protracted trade dispute between the two countries . Six-in-ten U.S. adults have a negative opinion of China , up from 47 % in 2018 and the highest share since Pew Research Center began asking Americans this question in 2005 .
Our most recent panel survey , conducted Sept. 9-Oct. 3 with 3,154 adults — including 2,150 likely voters — checks back in with Americans interviewed for the political typology study . It finds that the two strongest Republican groups – the Business Conservatives and the Steadfast Conservatives – are more motivated to vote than other groups , with 67 % and 66 % , respectively , likely to turn out . Steadfast Conservatives are staunch critics of government and are socially conservative . Business Conservatives prefer limited government , but are far more moderate on social issues than Steadfast Conservatives and favor immigration reform . We estimate that these two groups constitute only 22 % of the general public , but because they are so engaged with politics , these groups make up 38 % of the likely electorate . On the left , the Solid Liberals are solidly Democratic in their vote preference ( 93 % ) among likely voters and are uniformly liberal across nearly every realm – government , the economy , business , the environment and foreign policy , as well as on social issues . But they are somewhat less likely than the two conservative groups to vote ; we forecasted that 54 % of them will turn out to vote .
Before the outbreak , Americans strongly believed their personal data was more vulnerable than in the past . In a June 2019 survey , 70 % of Americans said their personal information was less secure than it was five years earlier . Just 6 % of Americans said they felt their information was more secure than in the past , while 24 % said their personal information was about as secure as it was five years earlier . Experts have suggested that data security could be threatened for companies shifting to remote work – as well as ordinary people who are spending more time online – during the coronavirus outbreak .
Sharp growth in illegal immigration and increased enforcement of immigration laws have dramatically altered the ethnic composition of offenders sentenced in federal courts . In 2007 , Latinos accounted for 40 % of all sentenced federal offenders—more than triple their share ( 13 % ) of the total U.S. adult population . The share of all sentenced offenders who were Latino in 2007 was up from 24 % in 1991 , according to an analysis of data from the United States Sentencing Commission ( USSC ) by the Pew Hispanic Center , a project of the Pew Research Center . This heightened focus on immigration enforcement has also changed the citizenship profile of federal offenders . In 2007 , Latinos without U.S. citizenship represented 29 % of all federal offenders . Among all Latino offenders , some 72 % were not U.S. citizens , up from 61 % in 1991 . By contrast , a much smaller share of white offenders ( 8 % ) and black offenders ( 6 % ) who were sentenced in federal courts in 2007 were not U.S. citizens .
Around a third ( 36 % ) of legislators in the four countries who tweeted about Floyd 's killing and racism commented on the protests spreading across the U.S. About 30 % discussed Trump and his handling of the protests – with seven times as many posts critical , as opposed to supportive . In the UK , 32 % of British legislators who tweeted about Floyd or `` Black lives matter '' lobbied for banning tear gas , rubber bullets and riot gear sales from the UK to the U.S .
Florida and Texas are home to the highest shares of Latinos among immigrant eligible voters . About 54 % of naturalized citizens who are eligible voters in Florida are Latino , the highest in the nation . Texas ( 52 % ) is the only other state where Latinos make up at least half of immigrant eligible voters .
As Congress faces an April 28 deadline to fund government operations , the public is now split in their general preferences on the size and scope of government : 48 % say they would rather have a bigger government providing more services , while 45 % prefer a smaller government providing fewer services . This marks the first time in eight years that as many Americans have expressed a preference for a bigger as a smaller government . Support for bigger government has increased 7 percentage points since last September , when more said they preferred a smaller government offering fewer services ( 50 % ) than a bigger government providing more services ( 41 % ) . The last time the public was divided on this question was in October 2008 , just prior to the election of Barack Obama .
`` Salvadoran '' is the identity term used most often . When asked in a 2013 Pew Research Center survey what term they use to describe themselves most often , about half of Salvadoran adults ( 49 % ) say they most often use term `` Salvadoran . '' Some 12 % say they describe themselves most often as `` American . '' About one-third ( 36 % ) most often use the pan-ethnic terms of `` Hispanic '' or `` Latino '' to describe their identity . By comparison , 54 % of all U.S. Hispanics say they prefer their ancestor 's Hispanic origin term to describe their identity , 23 % say they describe themselves most often as `` American '' and two-in-ten use the pan-ethnic terms of `` Hispanic '' or `` Latino '' to describe their identity . In regard to the pan-ethnic terms of `` Hispanic '' or `` Latino , '' about half of Salvadoran adults ( 49 % ) have no preference for either term . Among those who have a preference , more prefer the term `` Hispanic '' ( 28 % of all Salvadorans ) , while 22 % prefer the term `` Latino . '' By comparison , half of all Hispanic adults have no preference for either term , and among those who do have a preference , Hispanic is favored over Latino 2-to-1 . When asked in the 2013 Pew Research survey whether they thought of themselves as a typical American or very different from a typical American , Salvadorans are more likely to see themselves as `` very different from a typical American '' ( 51 % ) compared with about one-third of Salvadoran adults ( 35 % ) who see themselves as `` a typical American . '' By comparison , Hispanic adults overall are more likely to think of themselves as typical Americans ( 49 % ) than very different from a typical American ( 44 % ) .
Awareness of contact tracing and perceptions of how often scams happen are linked to the steps people say they would be likely or comfortable to take in the process . Some seven-in-ten U.S. adults had seen or heard a great deal or some about contact tracing at the time this survey was taken in July , whereas three-in-ten ( 29 % ) had heard nothing at all or not too much about this process . Those who had seen or heard not much or nothing at all are least likely to say they would be comfortable or likely to engage with all three contact tracing steps explored here ( `` speak , share , quarantine '' ) .
People in most surveyed nations embrace cooperation with other countries when dealing with major international issues . A median of 58 % say their country should take other countries ' interests into account when dealing with major international issues , even if it means making compromises . Majorities hold this view in 10 of 14 countries polled . Views are more divided in Italy and Denmark . And in Australia and Japan , half of adults or more say their nation should follow its own interests , even when other countries strongly disagree .
While that initial boost faded over time , Clinton 's approval rating in August 1998 was still a robust 62 % , where it remained for months – throughout his admission of the affair , the release of the Starr report and the opening of impeachment proceedings . Clinton 's approval hit 71 % again in mid-December , after the House vote to impeach him .
Americans are also closely divided over whether transgender people should be able to use public restrooms that correspond to their current gender identity . Roughly half of all adults ( 51 % ) say transgender people should be able to use the restroom that matches the gender with which they currently identify , while 46 % say they should be required to use the restroom of their birth gender . In addition , young adults – those ages 18 - 29 – are far more likely than their elders to take the position that transgender people should be allowed to use restrooms that correspond to their current gender identify . Two-thirds ( 67 % ) of Americans say employers should be required to provide birth control to employees through their health insurance plans , even if the business owner has religious objections to contraception . Weekly churchgoers , however , are more evenly split on this issue ; about half ( 46 % ) say business owners should have a right to decline coverage of contraception based on religious beliefs .
Far more voters expect voting to be difficult this year than in 2018 , according to a survey of registered voters conducted July 27 to Aug. 2 . Around half of registered voters ( 49 % ) said they expect voting to be very or somewhat difficult this year , while the other half ( 50 % ) expect it to be very or somewhat easy . That represents a major change from October 2018 , when just 15 % of voters said they expected voting in that year 's midterms to be difficult and 85 % said they expected it to be easy .
The results were mixed in several senses . There was no overwhelming public clamor for any of the activities . Still , there was fairly consistent interest in them and there was a notable segment of population – a quarter or more of respondents – who said they would definitely use each of the activities we queried and most times more than half the public said it was at least somewhat likely to take advantage of these new services . Many of those who responded to this battery of questions picked different types of services that they would prefer – in other words , there was only modest share of respondents who said they would `` very likely '' use each and every one of the news services that we queried .
A new Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking Poll , from which this chart of the week is taken , suggests that , despite the `` invincible '' tag , young adults are worried about their ability to foot medical bills . More than three-quarters of those ages 18 to 25 regard health insurance as something important for them to have , something they need and something that is worth the cost . About two-thirds of young adults — roughly the same number as the general population — worry about medical bills that might result from a serious illness or accident . The survey , conducted June 4 - 9 , did find a higher percentage of young adults than the overall population who believed they were healthy enough and did n't really need insurance , but this still only constituted 24 % of their age group compared to 11 % of all adults .
Income inequality in the U.S. is now greatest among Asians . In 2016 , the latest year for which data are available , Asians near the top of their income distribution ( the 90th percentile ) had incomes 10.7 times greater than the incomes of Asians near the bottom of their income distribution ( the 10th percentile ) . The 90/10 ratio among Asians was notably greater than among blacks ( 9.8 ) , whites ( 7.8 ) and Hispanics ( 7.8 ) .
Democratic registered voters who are bothered the likely nominee is an older white man are slightly more likely than those who are not bothered by it to say they would vote for Biden in the November general election contest against Trump ( 89 % vs. 83 % ) . And they are especially likely to have a negative evaluation of the president : Nearly all in this group ( 97 % ) say they disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job in office , including nine-in-ten who strongly disapprove . Among Democratic voters who are not bothered the presumptive nominee is an older white man , 85 % disapprove , including 72 % who do so strongly .
When it comes to presidential elections , there are fewer competitive counties , and more counties in which Democrats or Republicans hold overwhelming vote advantages , than at any time in the past three decades or so – on-the-ground evidence of the heightened partisan polarization that characterizes U.S. politics today . In the 2012 election , there were only 275 counties – less than 9 % of all counties and county-equivalents in the nation – in which fewer than 5 percentage points separated Democrat Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of county-level voting data . That was the fewest closely contested counties since Ronald Reagan 's landslide re-election in 1984 .
There are also gender and educational differences in these views . Nearly two-thirds of women ( 64 % ) favor stricter gun laws , compared with 55 % of men . Adults with at least a four-year college degree are more likely than those who have not completed college to support stricter laws ( 72 % vs. 55 % ) .
More news consumers ‘ dual-screen ' live events : 27 % of Americans who watched the November 2012 election night returns `` dual-screened '' the event , using the internet and television at the same time to follow the live coverage .
Medians of nearly two-thirds say terrorism ( 66 % ) and cyberattacks ( 65 % ) pose major threats to their country , while roughly six-in-ten ( 61 % ) say the same about the spread of nuclear weapons . In nine countries , those on the ideological right are more likely than those on the left to say that terrorism is a major threat to their country .
Only about one-in-five Americans ( 18 % ) say they trust the federal government to do what is right just about always or most of the time . Two-thirds of Americans say they can trust the government only some of the time , while 14 % volunteer they can never trust the government .
When asked whether they think of themselves first as an American or as a Muslim , 47 % of Muslims in the U.S. think of themselves first in terms of their religion , while 28 % identify themselves first as Americans and 18 % volunteer that they identify as both . At 46 % , French Muslims are about equally as likely as those in the U.S. to think of themselves first as Muslim . However , Muslim Americans are less likely to identify primarily with their religion than are Muslims living in Britain , Germany , and Spain . Roughly six-in-ten Muslim Americans ( 62 % ) say that the quality of life for Muslim women in the U.S. is better than the quality of life for women in most Muslim countries , while 7 % say it is worse , and 23 % believe it is about the same . French Muslims are equally likely to think that life is better for Muslim women in their country , while in Britain , Germany and Spain , Muslims are somewhat less likely to hold this view .
The American public has long expressed negative views of some of Donald Trump 's personal traits and behaviors , including his temperament and his tweeting . A new national survey finds that just 15 % of U.S. adults say they like the way he conducts himself as president . A far larger share ( 53 % ) say they do n't like how he conducts himself , while another 30 % say they have mixed feelings .
Two-in-three Latino eligible voters live in just five states . California alone holds roughly a quarter of the nation 's Latino electorate , with 7.9 million Latino eligible voters . Texas is second with 5.6 million , followed by Florida ( 3.1 million ) , New York ( 2.0 million ) and Arizona ( 1.2 million ) . Latinos make up the highest share of eligible voters in New Mexico ( 43 % ) . The other top states are California ( 30 % ) , Texas ( 30 % ) , Arizona ( 24 % ) and Florida ( 20 % ) .
Since taking office earlier this year , Chinese President Xi Jinping has emphasized the need to crackdown on corruption , promising to pursue both high-level and low-level officials ( `` tigers '' and `` flies '' ) . Among the country 's average citizens , corruption is a growing concern . Fully 84 % described political corruption as a big problem in a spring 2013 Pew Research Center survey of China . More than half ( 53 % ) said it was a very big problem , up from 39 % five years ago . Among the 17 issues included on the survey , only inflation ( 59 % very big problem ) was rated as a bigger concern .
When asked how they feel about the future of different topics in their countries , opinions vary widely across issues . People are largely optimistic about the future of their country 's relations with other European nations , and they feel the same way about their country 's culture . However , there is considerably less optimism about the future regarding well-paying jobs and the way the political system works . European publics are especially pessimistic about reducing economic inequality – across the 14 EU nations surveyed , a median of just 23 % are optimistic about reducing the gap between rich and poor in their country .
While Democrats are far more supportive than Republicans of legalizing the use of marijuana , they have similar views of a hypothetical presidential candidate who used marijuana in the past . Large majorities of Democrats ( 78 % ) and Republicans ( 74 % ) say a candidate 's past use of marijuana would not matter . Democrats and Republicans also have about the same views of a candidate who has had personal financial troubles . Roughly four-in-ten in both parties ( 42 % ) say they would be less likely to support such a candidate , while 50 % of Republicans and 48 % of Democrats say this would not matter .
Over the course of the nation 's history , there has been a slow but steady decrease in the size of the average U.S. household – from 5.79 people per household in 1790 to 2.58 in 2010 . But this decade will likely be the first since the one that began in 1850 to break this long-running trend , according to newly released Census Bureau data . In 2018 there were 2.63 people per household . Households are increasing in size mathematically because the growth in the number of households is trailing population growth . The newly released data indicates that the population residing in households has grown 6 % since 2010 ( the smallest population growth since the 1930s ) , while the number of households has grown at a slower rate ( 4 % , from 116.7 million in 2010 to 121.5 million in 2018 ) .
Overall , eight-in-ten Americans say social media platforms are very ( 31 % ) or somewhat ( 49 % ) effective for raising public awareness about political or social issues , according to the survey of U.S. adults conducted July 13 - 19 . A similar share ( 77 % ) believes these platforms are at least somewhat effective for creating sustained social movements . Democrats and independents who lean Democratic are more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say social media sites are at least somewhat effective as a way to raise public awareness about political or social issues ( 86 % vs. 74 % ) , create sustained social movements ( 82 % vs. 73 % ) and get elected officials to pay attention to issues ( 71 % vs. 59 % ) . Partisan gaps are more modest when it comes to these platforms ' effectiveness at influencing policy or changing people 's minds .
In 2012 , children with at least one unauthorized immigrant parent accounted for 6.9 % of U.S. students in kindergarten through 12th grade . A significant majority of these students were born in the U.S. ( representing 5.5 % of all students in 2012 ) ; the rest ( 1.4 % of all students ) are unauthorized immigrants themselves . The share of these students with unauthorized immigrant parents climbed to 7.2 % in 2007 from 3.2 % in 1995 .
Americans enter this key stretch feeling good about the Supreme Court . While a 62 % majority of Americans overall have a favorable opinion of the court , Christians are more likely than religiously unaffiliated Americans to see it favorably ( 69 % vs. 51 % ) . This includes about seven-in-ten among white evangelical Protestants , white Protestants who do not identify as born-again or evangelical Christians ( 72 % each ) , and Catholics ( 70 % ) , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in July 2019 .
Throughout Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's term in office , international perceptions of India have been mostly positive . Majorities in all five Asia-Pacific countries surveyed have a favorable view of India , with such positive judgement ranging from 64 % in South Korea to 57 % in Indonesia and Australia . Half the American public also shares this upbeat opinion of the world 's largest democracy . Compared with 2014 , the year Modi first came to office as prime minister , views of India abroad have largely remained stable . Favorable views have increased by a negligible 5 percentage points in South Korea , while they have decreased by the same amount in Japan , Indonesia and the U.S . The Philippines holds more positive views today than four years ago , with a 13-point increase in Indian favorability over that time .
A clear majority of U.S. adults think recent reports of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church reflect problems that are still happening . Around eight-in-ten Americans ( 79 % ) say the reports of sexual abuse and misconduct by Catholic priests and bishops reflect ongoing problems , while far fewer ( 12 % ) think the reports reflect problems that happened in the past .
After the debate over health care reform , news about swine flu and the economy vied for public attention , with other stories registering less widely . Fully 45 % say they followed reports about the condition of the U.S. economy very closely ; 15 % name it as their most closely followed story of the week . According to a separate analysis of coverage by the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism , the health care debate took up about a third ( 32 % ) of the week 's newshole . Coverage of the economy was relatively modest , filling 9 % of the newshole . Reports about swine flu and the availability of a vaccine were followed very closely by a somewhat smaller percentage of the public ( 30 % ) . However , just as many call swine flu their top story of the week ( 16 % ) as cited the economy ( 15 % ) . In general , swine flu interest outpaced coverage : just 2 % of the newshole was devoted to the story last week .
Among U.S. adults , Twitter discourse is dominated by a small share of tweeters . The most prolific tweeters – those in the top 10 % by number of tweets – are responsible for 80 % of all tweets created by U.S. adults . That includes all types of tweets : original tweets , retweets and quote tweets .
Around the world , Catholics vary in their support for same-sex marriage and their acceptance of homosexuality in general , according to Pew Research Center surveys conducted in recent years . ( The Center does not have recent survey data on views about civil unions . ) In the United States , about six-in-ten Catholics ( 61 % ) said in a 2019 survey that they favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry . Same-sex marriage became legal across the U.S. following a Supreme Court ruling in 2015 . In Western Europe , large majorities of Catholics said in 2017 that they support legal same-sex marriage . That was the case in the Netherlands ( 92 % ) , the United Kingdom ( 78 % ) , France ( 74 % ) and Germany ( 70 % ) . Same-sex marriage is legal in most of the Western European countries surveyed . In Switzerland and Italy – which allow civil unions but not marriage for gay couples – 76 % and 57 % of Catholics , respectively , said in 2017 that they support gay marriage .
Less often than a year ago , Mexicans say their government is making progress in its campaign against drug traffickers ; 37 % say this is the case , compared with 47 % in 2012 . An additional 29 % now say the government is losing ground against the cartels , and 30 % see no change in the way things are going . As in the past , Mexicans overwhelmingly support the use of the Mexican army to fight drug traffickers ; 85 % are in favor of this approach . There is also support for some cooperation from the U.S. in the fight against Mexican drug cartels . About three-quarters ( 74 % ) would welcome U.S. assistance in training Mexican police and military personnel . A majority ( 55 % ) would also approve of the U.S. providing money and weapons to the country 's police and military , although this position has lost some support in recent years ; 61 % backed this form of U.S. assistance in 2012 and 64 % did so in 2011 . However , there is little enthusiasm for the deployment of U.S. troops to Mexico to fight drug traffickers ; just 34 % of Mexicans would welcome this approach , while 59 % would oppose it .
Overall ratings for China are relatively unchanged since last year . Fifty-four percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of China , while just 38 % hold a favorable opinion . In each Pew Research Center survey since 2013 , roughly half or more of those surveyed have expressed a negative view of China . Prior to 2013 , the most negative rating for China was 42 % in 2008 .
As we saw with the other connected viewing experiences discussed above , younger cell owners are more likely than their elders to engage with others around televised content . This is especially true for posting one 's comments online and for sharing text messages with others watching the same program—for each of these activities , the youngest cell owners ( those ages 18 - 24 ) stand out even compared with those just a few years older .
News about the economy topped the public 's news interest last week , though many Americans also closely tracked the fallout from the midterm elections and the debate over enhanced security measures at the nation 's airports . About three-in-ten ( 29 % ) say they followed news about the economy more closely than other major stories , while 20 % say they followed news about the election outcome most closely . At the start of a busy holiday travel period , 14 % say they most closely followed news about tougher passenger screening procedures at airports , according to the latest News Interest Index survey conducted Nov. 18 - 21 among 1,004 adults . The media divided coverage among top stories , including the economy ( 11 % of coverage ) and the election outcome ( 9 % ) , according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism . News about airport security screening procedures made up 6 % of the newshole measured by PEJ , while coverage of the situation in Afghanistan accounted for 7 % .
Moreover , the share saying they do not want their own representative reelected – 38 % – is as high as it has been in two decades . At this stage in the 2010 and 2006 midterms , fewer wanted to see their own member of Congress defeated ( 29 % in November 2009 , 25 % in September 2005 ) .
Americans and Europeans do n't always agree on questions about morality , especially on issues related to sexuality . For instance , while just 30 % in the U.S. think sex between unmarried adults is morally unacceptable , this is nonetheless significantly higher than what our 2013 poll found in Europe . And while adultery is widely frowned upon in the EU – except , notably , in France – Americans are even more likely to say having an affair is morally unacceptable .
Most Europeans doubt that Muslims coming into their countries want to adopt their national customs and way of life . Substantial majorities in Germany ( 76 % ) , Great Britain ( 64 % ) , Spain ( 67 % ) and Russia ( 69 % ) say that Muslims in their country want to remain distinct from the larger society .
The survey finds little change in recent years in people 's views about the fairness of their own tax burden . Just over half ( 54 % ) say they pay about the right amount in taxes , considering what they get from the federal government , while 40 % say they pay more than their fair share . Only 5 % say they pay less than what they should .
The Hispanic population grew to 53 million in 2012 , a 50 % increase since 2000 and nearly six times the population in 1970 , according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data . Meanwhile , the overall U.S. population increased by only 12 % from 2000 to 2012 . Hispanic population growth accounted for more than half of the country 's growth in this time period . Much of the growth is occurring in a relatively small geographic area . A Pew Research Center analysis last year found that the 10 largest counties by Hispanic population accounted for 22 % of the national Hispanic population growth between 2000 and 2011 . Half of these counties are located in California .
There has been a steady increase in the share of Americans who view racism as a big problem in the U.S. – especially among black Americans . Since 2009 , the first year of Barack Obama 's presidency , the share of those who consider racism a big problem has grown among all racial groups . This is especially true for black Americans . In 2017 , about eight-in-ten blacks ( 81 % ) said racism is a big problem in society today , up from 44 % eight years prior . By comparison , about half of whites ( 52 % ) said racism is a big problem in our society , up from 22 % in 2009 . There were also partisan divides on this question , which have grown from 2015 .
Young people are among the least likely to regularly watch network news : 11 % of those 18 - 29 in 2012 , compared with 46 % of this age group in 1993 . About half ( 49 % ) of 18 - 29 year olds say they never watch . Older Americans , those 65 and up , are still far more likely to regularly watch network news than younger people , yet their regular viewership has dropped by almost half since 1993 , from 75 % down to 40 % in 2012 . According to Nielsen Media Research , the share of the public from the media 's highly coveted 25 - 54 year old demographic that watched NBC , ABC or CBS network news accounted for only 26 % of all viewers in the 2012 - 13 ratings season . The vast majority of viewers were older Americans ; a trend that is expected to continue .
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center , conducted May 12 - 18 among 2,002 adults ( including 1,497 registered voters ) , finds increasing interest in the presidential campaign . The share of registered voters who say they are giving at least some thought to the presidential candidates has risen eight points since March , from 58 % to 66 % . However , just 29 % of registered voters say they are giving `` a lot '' of thought to candidates who may be running for president in 2016 . Interest in the presidential candidates has increased among voters in both parties since March . Currently , 69 % of Republican and Republican-leaning voters say they are giving at least some thought to the candidates , up from 61 % in March . Among Democrats , 65 % are giving a lot or some thought to the candidates , compared with 57 % in March .
There is greater public support for cutting military spending in order to achieve deficit reduction . About half of Americans ( 51 % ) say reducing the deficit is more important than keeping military spending at current levels , while 40 % say deficit reduction is more important .

Far fewer want to hear more about Romney 's wealth ( 21 % ) , his family and upbringing ( 19 % ) or his religious beliefs ( 16 % ) .
Young men make up a disproportionately large share of people who play video games in the United States . But about four-in-ten women and roughly a quarter of Americans ages 65 and older also say they play video games at least sometimes , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March and April . As with other types of technology , video games are most popular among young adults . Six-in-ten Americans ages 18 to 29 and 53 % of those ages 30 to 49 say they play video games often or sometimes , compared with smaller shares in older age groups . The survey counts video games played on a computer , TV , game console or portable device , such as a mobile phone .
The 5.8 million unauthorized immigrants not eligible for deportation relief under President Obama 's executive actions are more likely than those eligible to be unmarried and not have U.S.-born children living with them , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis .
A majority of those age 18 to 29 ( 61 % ) say the U.S. should take into account allies ' interests even if it means making compromises . Only about a third ( 36 % ) say the U.S. should follow its own interests when allies strongly disagree . Adults age 65 and older are about evenly divided ( 47 % vs. 44 % ) . Large majorities of postgraduates ( 74 % ) and four-year college graduates ( 68 % ) say the U.S. should take allies ' interests into account . About half of those with some college education ( 52 % ) and 44 % of those with a high school education or less agree . Whites without a college degree are about equally divided between compromising with allies ( 48 % ) and following U.S. national interests when allies disagree ( 45 % ) . College-educated whites largely favor taking into account allies ' interests and compromising when necessary ( 70 % say this ) .
While there is broad opposition among Republicans to the Iran nuclear deal , more conservative Republican voters ( 74 % ) than moderates and liberals ( 56 % ) say they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to end the agreement . Republicans also are divided in views of a presidential candidate who will compromise with Democrats . Roughly half of moderate and liberal Republican voters ( 54 % ) would be more likely to support a candidate who will compromise with Democrats , compared with just 36 % of conservative Republicans . There are more modest ideological differences over support for deporting all immigrants in the U.S. illegally and raising taxes on the wealthy . On balance , conservative Republican voters say they would be more likely to support a candidate who wants to deport immigrants here illegally ( 45 % more likely , 26 % less likely ) . Moderate and liberal Republicans are divided ( 37 % more likely , 39 % less likely ) . Somewhat more moderate and liberal Republican voters ( 39 % ) than conservative Republican voters ( 27 % ) say they would be more likely to support a candidate who wants to raise taxes on wealthy Americans .
When this question was first posed in 1990 , seven-in-ten Americans viewed the UN favorably and the partisan divide was minimal . Nearly equal numbers of Democrats ( 73 % ) and Republicans ( 68 % ) shared a positive view of the UN . There was a dip in favorability in the late ' 90s ( possibly on account of the troubled UN peacekeeping mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina ) , but overall views of the international organization were positive among both Democrats and Republicans through 2001 , before 9/11 . However , by 2004 , following the start of the Iraq War in 2003 , views of the UN among Republicans had plummeted below 50 % and have not recovered , while attitudes among Democrats dropped somewhat – particularly in 2006 and 2007 – but rose through the Obama era . Consequently , the current U.S. partisan divide on favorable views of the UN ( a 37-percentage-point difference between Democrats and Republicans ) is the largest we have measured .
For many Americans , `` socialism '' is a word that evokes a weakened work ethic , stifled innovation and excessive reliance on the government . For others , it represents a fairer , more generous society . Earlier this year , Pew Research Center found that 55 % of Americans had a negative impression of `` socialism , '' while 42 % expressed a positive view . About two-thirds ( 65 % ) said they had a positive view of `` capitalism , '' and a third viewed it negatively . Some who view socialism negatively portray it as a serious threat to capitalism in the U.S. , while others who view it positively say the opposite – that it builds upon and improves capitalism . And some who have a positive view of socialism express an explicit preference for a system that blends socialism and capitalism .
Today , 38 % of Republicans say they are excited and 48 % are relieved that Trump won , while 13 % say they are disappointed . In pre-election surveys , fewer Republicans anticipated they would feel excited about a Trump victory , while greater shares expected they would feel disappointed .
A majority of Americans believe local journalists should not express their views on local issues , but Republicans are considerably more likely than Democrats to feel this way , according to a new Pew Research Center survey that also finds substantial partisan differences over other aspects of local news reporting . Overall , 61 % of U.S. adults feel that local journalists should not share their views about local issues and events , compared with 36 % who say they should , according to the survey , conducted Oct. 15-Nov. 8 , 2018 , among nearly 35,000 U.S. adults . Republicans and GOP-leaning independents are more than twice as likely to say local journalists should not express their views ( 71 % ) as they are to say they should express their views on local issues ( 28 % ) . Democrats and Democratic leaners are more evenly divided , with 54 % saying local journalists should not express their views and 44 % saying they should . The partisan divide on this question is similar to one found in an earlier Pew Research Center survey that asked whether the news media in general should present the facts with some interpretation , rather than without interpretation . While the divide between Republicans and Democrats over whether local journalists should express their views on local issues is among the largest partisan gaps found in the Center 's new survey , other measures also show substantial gaps by party .
Support for the European Union may be rebounding just in time for the European Parliament elections , according to a new survey of seven EU nations by the Pew Research Center . After a dramatic decline in the wake of the euro crisis , EU favorability is now on the rise in France , the United Kingdom , and Germany . And faith in one of the EU 's founding principles – that European economic integration is good for their own country – is up in the UK , Poland and Germany . These are some of the findings from a new Pew Research Center survey of 7,022 people in seven European Union member countries – France , Germany , Greece , Italy , Poland , Spain and the United Kingdom – conducted from March 17 to April 9 , 2014 .
A record 8 % of households with minor children in the U.S. are headed by a single father , up from just over 1 % in 1960 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of census records . The census bureau data shows the number of single father households increased from less than 300,000 in 1960 to more than 2.6 million in 2011 . Compared with fathers who head households with two married parents , single dads are younger , less educated , less financially well-off and less likely to be white . Read more
Along with being the most popular social media site , Facebook users also visit the site with high levels of frequency . Fully 74 % of Facebook users say they visit the site daily , with around half ( 51 % ) saying they do several times a day . The share of Facebook users who visit the site on a daily basis is statistically unchanged compared with 2016 , when 76 % of Facebook users reported they visited the site daily . While the overall share of Americans who use Snapchat is smaller than that of Facebook , a similar share of Snapchat users ( 49 % ) say they use the platform multiple times per day . All told , a majority of Snapchat ( 63 % ) and Instagram ( 60 % ) users indicate that they visit these platforms on a daily basis . The share of Instagram users who visit the platform daily has increased slightly since 2016 when 51 % of Instagram users were daily visitors . ( Note : this is the first year the Center has specifically asked about the frequency of Snapchat use in a telephone poll . )
U.S. Census Bureau data show that 144,000 more people left the island for the mainland than the other way around from mid-2010 to 2013 , a larger gap between emigrants and migrants than during the entire decades of the 1970s , 1980s or 1990s . This escalated loss of migrants fueled the island 's first sustained population decline in its history as a U.S. territory , even as the stateside Puerto Rican population grew briskly .
The survey includes two questions designed to test understanding of scientific processes . Six-in-ten Americans ( 60 % ) can identify that adding a control group is the best of four options to use to test whether an ear infection medication is effective . And 52 % correctly identify a scientific hypothesis about a computer slowing down .
It is not an exaggeration to say that the rise and fall of the unemployment rate more than any other factor shaped general public reaction to Reagan in his first term . As unemployment rose from 7.5 % at the start of 1981 to more than 8.6 % by January 1982 , his job disapproval rating rose from 18 % to 40 % over this period . By the end of 1982 , unemployment stood at nearly 11 % and 50 % of the public was telling Gallup that it disapproved of how the president was handling his job . Fortunately for Reagan , 1983 saw unemployment begin to decline . By year 's end , his approval scores began to recover , setting the stage for his successful run for reelection in 1984 .
Health care has also remained a key challenge in sub-Saharan Africa . Roughly eight-in-ten ( median of 82 % ) across the nine countries surveyed say poor-quality health care is a very big problem in their nation . On this issue , sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind other areas of the world on key indicators such as the mortality rates for children under 5 and for mothers . Between 1990 and 2015 , sub-Saharan Africa decreased the number of deaths among children under 5 by 52 % . Even so , the region continues to have the highest under-5 mortality rate , with 86 deaths per 1,000 live births . And while maternal deaths dropped by 49 % since 1990 , sub-Saharan Africa still has a maternal mortality rate more than twice that of any other region ( 510 per 100,000 live births in sub-Saharan Africa compared with 190 in Southern Asia , the next-highest ) .
Overall , Americans largely say the public should not be expected to know when a video or image has been altered or made up entirely . About six-in-ten U.S. adults ( 61 % ) say it is too much to ask of the average American to be able to recognize altered videos and images , while fewer than half ( 38 % ) say the public should be able to recognize them . Overall , Americans place less responsibility on the public – and less faith in their own abilities – to recognize altered videos than they do with other forms of potentially inaccurate or misleading forms of information . The public is less likely to say the average American should be able to recognize altered videos than they are to say the same about made-up news and information , unverified breaking information , one-sided factual information , or satire about an issue or event . Americans are also less likely to say they can easily recognize altered videos themselves than say this about the other four types of misinformation the survey asked about .
Overall , children are overrepresented among America 's impoverished population . Some 22 % of the U.S. population are children , but those younger than 18 represent 31 % of all Americans living in poverty .
Among women , there is a significant age gap in views on this issue . A majority ( 60 % ) of women ages 65 and older say a woman should have children before entering politics , while only 30 % of women ages 18 to 29 say the same . Instead , four-in-ten women ages 18 to 29 say women should wait until they 're well established in their political careers to have children . Just one-quarter of women 65 and older say this is the best choice . Women 's views also differ by their level of education . About four-in-ten women without a four-year college degree ( 42 % ) say a woman has the best chance of success in politics if she has children early ; 57 % of women with a bachelor 's degree or higher say this . About one-third ( 32 % ) of less educated women , compared with 21 % of college graduates , say a woman who wants to reach high political office should wait until she is well established in her career to have children . Women who are mothers themselves have somewhat different views on this than women who do n't have young children . Mothers of children younger than 18 are more likely than other women to say a woman who aspires to high political office should wait until she 's established in her political career before having children . About one-third ( 36 % ) of mothers say a woman who wants to reach this type of position is better off waiting to have children , compared with 26 % of those without children under 18 .
The public continues to track news about the U.S. economy closely as American automakers struggle , stock markets prove volatile , real estate values drop further , and jobs disappear . Nearly half ( 48 % ) say they followed economic news last week very closely . Three-in-ten say they followed news about the economy more closely than any other story last week . According to PEJ , news about the economic crisis took up 35 % of the newshole . More than a quarter ( 28 % ) say they followed Obama 's budget proposal very closely , while 17 % say that was the story they followed most closely last week . Budget coverage filled about 6 % of the newshole . The menacing floods in Fargo , N.D. , attracted the very close attention of 24 % of the public , while 13 % say that was the story they followed most closely . Stories about the flooding that forced the evacuation of thousands made up 5 % of the newshole . About a third ( 36 % ) say they very closely followed news about the Obama administration 's plans to expand financial regulation of financial institutions in response to the economic crisis ; 8 % say that was the story they followed most closely .
Majorities across all major demographic groups say they are not too or not at all bothered by stores and businesses requiring a face-covering . Republicans are relatively more likely to say they are bothered by this than Democrats . Still , just 36 % of Republicans are bothered a lot or some by such requirements , compared with 64 % who say the requirements do n't bother them much or at all . Large shares of Americans across groups report wearing a mask when out in public . Nearly nine-in-ten ( 87 % ) adults say they have worn a mask or face covering all or most of the time when in stores and businesses over the past month , including 91 % of Democrats and 81 % of Republicans . While a slightly larger majority of Democrats than Republicans reports wearing a mask in stores , the partisan gap is much smaller than it was in June ( 23 points ) .
The survey of publics in 39 countries finds broad acceptance of homosexuality in North America , the European Union , and much of Latin America , but equally widespread rejection in predominantly Muslim nations and in Africa , as well as in parts of Asia and in Russia . Opinion about the acceptability of homosexuality is divided in Israel , Poland and Bolivia .
Central and Eastern Europeans in the EU are less willing than Western Europeans in the EU to say they would accept Muslims or Jews as members of their family or as neighbors . In nearly all of the Central and Eastern European countries surveyed , fewer than half of adults say they would be willing to accept Muslims into their family , including 29 % who say this in Romania and 32 % in Bulgaria . Meanwhile , in most of the surveyed Western European countries , more than half of adults say they would accept a Muslim into their family , including 66 % who say this in Finland and 74 % in Spain . The same general pattern holds when Europeans are asked about accepting Jews as family members or neighbors .
The nation 's foreign-born population is projected to reach 78 million by 2060 , making up 18.8 % of the total U.S. population , according to new Census Bureau population projections . That would be a new record for the foreign-born share , with the bureau projecting that the previous record high of 14.8 % in 1890 will be passed as soon as 2025 . Yet while Asian and Hispanic immigrants are projected to continue to be the main sources of U.S. immigrant population growth , the new projections show that the share of the foreign born is expected to fall among these two groups . Today , 66.0 % of U.S. Asians are immigrants , but that share is predicted to fall to 55.4 % by 2060 . And while about a third of U.S. Hispanics ( 34.9 % ) are now foreign-born , the Census Bureau projects that this share too will fall , to 27.4 % in 2060 . These declines are due to the growing importance of births as drivers of each group 's population growth . Already , for Hispanics , U.S. births drive 78 % of population growth . Meanwhile , foreign-born shares among whites and blacks are expected to rise . Today , 8.9 % of those who identify as black were born in another country , but that number is projected to almost double – to 16.5 % – by 2060 . Among whites , 4.1 % are foreign-born today , but that share is projected to double to 8.1 % in 2060 .
Survey experiments also may involve randomizing specific details within a question to better understand nuances in views . For example , a report about Americans ' views about elections included a question that described a hypothetical election with 1 million voters in which one person voted even though they were not eligible to do so . Around four-in-ten Americans ( 41 % ) said this would be a `` major problem . '' But the question also included a set of variations that were randomly assigned . In those versions , the number of people who were described as voting despite being ineligible to vote changed . While some people received the scenario in which one person voted despite being ineligible , others were asked about 10 , 100 , 1,000 , or 10,000 people voting despite being ineligible . The experiment found that 69 % of U.S. adults said that 10,000 people voting despite being ineligible was a major problem , compared with 41 % who said the same about one ineligible person voting . Since respondents were randomly assigned into each version of the question , these differences can be attributed to the changing information itself , not the attributes of the people who responded .
A 2014 Pew Research Center survey of 43 countries around the world showed that a median of 65 % of people in Latin America had a positive view of the U.S . While not quite as positive as attitudes toward America in Africa ( 74 % ) , this level of approval is on par with views in Europe ( 66 % ) and Asia ( 66 % ) and much higher than in the Middle East ( 30 % ) . The survey was conducted last spring before Obama 's diplomatic opening to Cuba . Majorities in all but one of nine Latin American countries surveyed view the U.S. favorably . Attitudes toward the U.S. have remained positive or grown more favorable in four countries Pew Research surveyed in both 2007 and 2014 . In 2007 , a majority of Chileans ( 55 % ) said they had a favorable view of the U.S . This number jumped to 72 % in 2014 , an increase of 17 percentage points . And in Argentina , the Latin American country most critical of the U.S. , favorable views have jumped 20 points , from only 16 % in 2007 to 36 % now . The change has been less marked in Mexico , where favorable opinions of the U.S. have increased by 7 percentage points ( 56 % favorable in 2007 vs. 63 % in 2014 ) . Favorable views of the U.S. in Peru remained steady , going from 61 % in 2007 to 65 % in the latest survey .
Our analysis found that lame duck sessions are shouldering more of the legislative workload than they used to . The last Congress ' lame duck , which stretched from November 2012 past New Year 's Day 2013 , passed only 87 public laws , but that was 30.7 % of the Congress ' entire two-year output and 31.3 % of its substantive output ( that is , excluding post-office renamings , National `` fill-in-the-blank '' Week designations and other purely ceremonial legislation ) . In 2010 , the 99 public laws passed during the 111th Congress ' lame duck session accounted for 25.8 % of all that Congress ' laws ( and 29.2 % of its substantive laws ) .
Italian opinion about the influence immigrants were having on their country was also among the most negative of the 47 nations surveyed in 2007 . Nearly three-quarters of Italians ( 73 % ) said immigrants had a bad impact on their country ; only in South Africa was this view as widespread — 75 % of South Africans said immigrants had a negative influence on their country . Italy was the only country of the Western European nations surveyed where a majority viewed the impact of immigrants negatively . Publics in Britain , France , Germany and Spain were divided , while the Swedes had an overwhelmingly positive view of the influence immigrants had on their country .
When those who cite multiple frustrations with the tax system are asked what bothers them most , a similar hierarchy of concerns is evident : About a quarter of the public ( 28 % ) says they are most bothered by the feeling that corporations do not pay their fair share and 25 % say the same about wealthy people not paying their fair share . Fewer ( 19 % ) point to the complexity of the tax system , while much smaller percentages cite the amount they pay in taxes ( 7 % ) and the feeling that the poor do n't pay their fair share ( 4 % ) . The national survey by the Pew Research Center , conducted Feb. 18 - 22 among 1,504 adults , finds that about half ( 53 % ) say they pay about the right amount in taxes , considering what they get from the federal government ; fewer ( 40 % ) feel like they pay more than their fair share in taxes . Just 4 % say they pay less than their fair share of taxes . These views have changed little since December 2011 .
Tension between the U.S. and Iran over shipping in the Persian Gulf was the top story for 8 % . Nearly a quarter ( 23 % ) say they followed this news very closely . Republicans are more likely to say they followed these developments very closely than are Democrats ( 29 % vs. 19 % ) ; 23 % of independents say this as well . News about Iran more generally accounted for 4 % of coverage . News about the leadership changes in North Korea attracted modest attention and little coverage last week . Following the December death of Kim Jong-il , his son , Kim Jong-un took control of the country 's government . News about the situation in North Korea was the top story last week for 5 % , while 17 % say they followed the situation there very closely . News about the changes in North Korea accounted for less than 1 % of coverage last week . Another 5 % say their top story was news about the arsonist in Los Angeles who apparently set fire to more than 50 automobiles ; 13 % say they followed this news very closely . News about the fires and the man arrested by police as the suspected arsonist accounted for 3 % of coverage .
The assassination of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto comes at a time when Pakistani public opinion has been increasingly turning against extremism and terrorist violence . As the 2007 Pew Global Attitudes survey highlighted , support for terrorism is on the decline in much of the Muslim world , and this is particularly true in Pakistan . In 2004 , 41 % of Pakistani Muslims said that suicide bombing and other forms of violence against civilians were `` often '' or `` sometimes justified '' in order to defend Islam from its enemies , while only 35 % felt that such attacks were never justified . In the spring of this year – just months before a suicide attacker would kill Bhutto – only 9 % said suicide attacks are often or sometimes justified , while 72 % said this kind of violence is never defensible ( another 9 % say they are `` rarely '' justified ) .
The number of online adults who have used online classified ads has more than doubled in the past four years . Almost half ( 49 % ) of internet users say they have ever used online classified sites , compared with 22 % of online adults who had done so in 2005 .
When it comes to the sort of background Americans say they want to see in presidential candidates , governing at the state level is seen more positively than extensive Washington experience . In a 2014 Pew Research Center survey , 30 % said they 'd be less likely to support a candidate with `` many years '' of experience as an elected official in Washington , while 19 % would be more likely to support such a candidate . The same survey found that 33 % would be more likely to support a candidate who had served as a governor , versus just 5 % who said they 'd be less likely . ( We did n't ask about Cabinet members . ) A separate measure found that congressional service has lost ground to gubernatorial experience in terms of which is perceived as better preparation for the presidency . As recently as 2007 , more than twice as many people said serving in Congress was better preparation than being a state 's governor ; last year , both options were tied .
Registered voters who support Donald Trump are about twice as likely as registered voters who support Joe Biden to say that the news sources they turn to most often have reported made-up information that is intended to mislead the public ( 45 % vs. 22 % ) . They are also somewhat more likely to say their news sources have reported breaking information that has n't been fully verified ( 59 % vs. 50 % ) and factual information presented to favor one side of an issue ( 73 % vs. 64 % ) .
The United States has long been the top destination country for migrants worldwide , though if the European Union , Norway and Switzerland were a single country it would outrank the U.S. as a destination for international migrants . But the U.S. and Europe are quite different when it comes to their migrant populations ' origin countries . In 2015 , almost one-in-five ( 19 % ) of all international migrants – people living in a country other than the one they were born in – lived in the U.S. , and 23 % were in the EU , Norway and Switzerland . Together , some 43 % of all the world 's international migrants live in the U.S. or Europe , according to the United Nations Population Division . ( The UN counts citizens born abroad or in their native country 's territories as international migrants . For the U.S. , this means international migrants include U.S. citizens at birth who were born abroad , in Puerto Rico or in other U.S . territories . ) The U.S. has long been a receiving country for international migrants , and Europe historically was a sending region . For most of the 20th century , either Germany or Italy was the top country of origin of migrants living in the U.S. A century ago , from 1890 to 1919 , almost nine-in-ten foreign-born people arriving to the U.S. ( 88 % ) were coming from Europe , compared with just 12 % of migrants who arrived since 1965 . About 46.6 million immigrants now live in the U.S. , making up a near-historic 14 % of the U.S. population , according to UN data – but as of 2015 , only about one-in-ten immigrants living in the U.S. ( 9 % ) were born in the EU , Norway and Switzerland .
Fully 75 % of adults say that adult children have a responsibility to provide financial assistance to an elderly parent in need . Only 23 % say this is not an adult child 's responsibility . By contrast , only about half of all respondents ( 52 % ) say parents have a responsibility to provide financial assistance to a grown child if he or she needs it . Some 44 % say parents do not have a responsibility to do this . When it comes to providing financial support to an aging parent in need , there is strong support for the responsibility to do so across most major demographic groups . However , there are significant differences across age groups . Adults under age 40 are the most likely to say an adult child has a responsibility to support an elderly parent in need . Eight-in-ten in this age group ( 81 % ) say this is a responsibility , compared with 75 % of middle-aged adults and 68 % of those ages 60 or older .
Public trust in the government remains near historic lows . Only 17 % of Americans today say they can trust the government in Washington to do what is right `` just about always '' ( 3 % ) or `` most of the time '' ( 14 % ) . When the National Election Study began asking about trust in government in 1958 , about three-quarters of Americans trusted the federal government to do the right thing almost always or most of the time . Trust in government began eroding during the 1960s , amid the escalation of the Vietnam War , and the decline continued in the 1970s with the Watergate scandal and worsening economic struggles . Confidence in government recovered in the mid-1980s before falling again in the mid-1990s . But as the economy grew in the late 1990s so too did confidence in government . Public trust reached a three-decade high shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , but declined quickly thereafter . Since 2007 , the share saying they can trust the government always or most of the time has not surpassed 30 % .
While the killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan by U.S. military forces attracted a near-record amount of news coverage , public interest in the story has been comparatively modest . Just more than four-in-ten ( 42 % ) say they followed news about the Al Qaeda leader 's killing more closely than any other news last week . One-in-five ( 20 % ) followed news about severe weather and flooding in the South and Midwest most closely . Bin Laden 's death is clearly the week 's top story , but it is not the top story for 2011 . In mid-March , far more ( 57 % ) said they followed the Japan earthquake and nuclear disaster most closely . Fully 69 % of news coverage for the week was devoted to bin Laden 's killing , according to a separate analysis by Pew Research 's Project for Excellence in Journalism . Since PEJ began tracking news coverage in early 2007 , only one story has approached the level of coverage bin Laden 's death received : In late August 2008 , the media devoted just less than 69 % to the presidential campaign during the week in which Democrats nominated Barack Obama and John McCain introduced Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate .
The seven columns on the left side of the chart show how the white share of the vote for president has steadily declined over the past quarter century . The two columns on the right show the racial composition of the population now and in 2060 , as projected by the Census Bureau . A couple of patterns stand out . First , whites were 74 % of voters last year at a time when they were just 63 % of the population . This racial turnout gap is driven by the fact that a disproportionate share of non-whites are either too young to vote , not eligible to vote ( because they 're not citizens ) , or just do n't vote . All of these factors could change over time .
The state of the U.S. economy and the health care debate in Washington shared the position of American 's top story last week . One-in-five named either the economy ( 21 % ) or health care ( 21 % ) as the news they followed more closely than any other . These two stories also received comparable levels of new coverage according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism : 13 % of total news was devoted to the economy and 11 % to the debate on reforming health care .
Republicans and Democrats differ substantially in views of how most of these groups will fare during Trump 's presidency . Sizable majorities of Democrats say a number of groups will lose influence with Trump in the White House : 81 % say the influence of the poor will decline ; 78 % say the same about Hispanics ; 74 % each say women and gays and lesbians will lose influence ; and 73 % say this about blacks . No more than about a third of Republicans say any of these groups will lose influence with Trump in the White House ( 33 % gays and lesbians , 32 % Hispanics ) . Most Republicans expect that these groups will either gain influence or not be affected by Trump 's presidency . On the other hand , 83 % of Democrats expect wealthy people to gain influence in Trump 's presidency , while close to two-thirds say the influence of men ( 65 % ) and whites ( 64 % ) will grow . By contrast , only about four-in-ten Republicans anticipate that the influence of these groups will increase ( 43 % wealthy people , 40 % whites , 36 % men ) .
There also is widespread disappointment among Muslims that Iraq did not put up more of a fight against the U.S. and its allies . Overwhelming majorities in Morocco ( 93 % ) , Jordan ( 91 % ) , Lebanon ( 82 % ) , Turkey ( 82 % ) , Indonesia ( 82 % ) , and the Palestinian Authority ( 81 % ) say they are disappointed the Iraqi military put up so little resistance . Many others around the world share that view , including people in South Korea ( 58 % ) , Brazil ( 50 % ) and Russia ( 45 % ) .
In Pew Center surveys conducted since the Iraq war earlier this year , 30 % of Americans identify themselves as Republicans , 31 % as Democrats and 39 % as independents or other . When that combined sample is winnowed to registered voters , the partisan breakdown is just as narrow ­ 33 % Republican , 34 % Democrat , 33 % independent or other .
Japan has a median age of 48 – more than 17 years above the global figure – and about a third of its inhabitants ( 34 % ) are 60 or older . In South Korea , another economically advanced country , the median age is 44 and nearly a quarter of the population ( 23 % ) is 60 or older . Both countries have very low fertility and unusually high life expectancies . And even though both countries have recently reported a `` second wave '' of coronavirus cases , the fatality rates there so far have been relatively low .
Those who had their computers fail most recently were equally likely to fix it themselves as they were to contact user support for help ( 29 % ) , but they were significantly less likely than those with internet connection or cell phone failures to contact user support . Some 45 % of those with internet failure and 43 % of those with cell phone problems contacted user support , compared with 29 % of those with computer problems to do so . Some 15 % of all technology users with failed devices fixed the problem with help from family or friends , and those with computer ( 18 % ) and internet ( 15 % ) failures were significantly more likely than those with cell phone problems ( 7 % ) to get help from family or friends . Cell phones were the device least likely to be fixed , as nearly one-fourth ( 23 % ) of those with broken cell phones were unable to fix problems they had with their cell phones . Some 19 % of those with broken computers reported not being able to fix their computers , while significantly fewer were left without internet ( 7 % ) . Put another way , while 77 % of cell phone owners were successful fixing their phones when they broke , 93 % of those whose home internet connection failed were able to fix it . When a home internet connection fails , broadband may be trickier to fix than dial-up without help from customer support . Based on those who reported a failed home internet connection , broadband users were much more likely to seek user support for help ( 49 % v. 27 % ) . The problems , however , were equally likely to be fixed , with just 6 % of dial-up users and 7 % of broadband users unable to fix the problem .
About seven-in-ten ( 71 % ) Hispanic eligible voters live in just six states in 2017 – California ( 7.7 million ) , Texas ( 5.4 million ) , Florida ( 3.0 million ) , New York ( 2.0 million ) , Arizona ( 1.1 million ) and Illinois ( 1.0 million ) . Hispanics make up the highest share of all eligible voters in New Mexico ( 42.6 % ) , followed by California ( 30.0 % ) , Texas ( 29.8 % ) , Arizona ( 23.4 % ) and Florida ( 19.8 % ) .
Last week , which included Super Tuesday contests in 10 states , 28 % say they followed election news very closely , according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey , conducted March 8 - 11 among 1,005 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press . Coverage also was greater four years ago . Last week , election news accounted for 30 % of coverage , according to the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism ( PEJ ) . The week of Super Tuesday in 2008 , campaign coverage accounted for 55 % of the newshole .
When asked which country besides their own is the best example of a developed economy , people in Kenya , South Africa and Nigeria overwhelmingly point to the United States and China , the world 's two largest economies . But among people in these three African nations , there are differences in the share of respondents who choose each power . In Kenya , 36 % say the U.S. is the best example of a developed country , while only 15 % choose China . An additional 4 % say Japan , South Africa or Tanzania are the best examples . Among South Africans , around a quarter each say the U.S. ( 27 % ) and China ( 22 % ) are the best examples of an advanced economy . An additional 5 % name Germany as a top example , with 4 % naming the United Kingdom , Australia , Botswana or `` Europe . '' In Nigeria , 28 % name China as the best example of a developed economy and a quarter cite the U.S. Another 4 % say Saudi Arabia .
About half ( 47 % ) of Republican voters also rate Chris Christie positively , yet unfavorable opinions of the New Jersey governor ( at 30 % ) are higher than for Ryan , Paul or Rubio . Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , while not very well known among GOP voters , is rated positively ( 33 % favorable , 13 % unfavorable ) .
The European Union , Norway and Switzerland received nearly 66,000 asylum applications from unaccompanied minor migrants in 2016 , a decline of nearly 40 % from 2015 's record total but still well above the total of prior years , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of data from Eurostat , the EU 's statistical agency . From 2008 to 2016 , the EU , Norway and Switzerland received some 274,000 total asylum applications from unaccompanied minors , or those younger than 18 applying without a parent or guardian . ( Data are not available before 2008 . ) The annual number of unaccompanied minor applications remained relatively flat from 2008 to 2013 before nearly doubling to 25,000 in 2014 . During the refugee surge in 2015 , European countries received more than 104,000 applications from unaccompanied minors seeking asylum . Counting all age groups , the EU , Norway and Switzerland received more than 4.8 million first-time asylum applications from 2008 to 2016 , with unaccompanied minors representing almost 6 % of the total .
From 1950 to 2000 , women 's labor force participation had increased rapidly ( particularly among married women and married mothers ) , while men 's participation declined . For example , during the 1960s the female labor force grew , on average , three times faster than the male labor force – 3.1 % per year versus 1.0 % per year . By 2000 , 59.9 % of women were in the labor force , up from 37.7 % in 1960 . This rapid growth boosted women 's representation in the work force overall . The steady growth in women 's labor force representation slowed in the 1990s as women 's participation peaked . Labor force participation declined for both men and women between 2000 and 2015 , so the growth rates of the male and female labor force are now quite similar on average : 0.8 % per year for women between 2000 and 2010 , compared with 0.7 % for men . ( The labor force can grow in spite of falling labor force participation because the working-age population is increasing . ) Looking forward , the BLS projections assume labor force participation will continue to decline for both men and women at similar rates . The result is that both labor forces are expected to grow by 0.5 % or less per year .
Black Americans are far less likely than whites to give police high marks for the way they do their jobs . In a 2016 survey , only about a third of black adults said that police in their community did an `` excellent '' or `` good '' job in using the right amount of force ( 33 % , compared with 75 % of whites ) , treating racial and ethnic groups equally ( 35 % vs. 75 % ) , and holding officers accountable for misconduct ( 31 % vs. 70 % ) .
Public attention to reports about the condition of the U.S. economy reached a 15 year high last week with 45 % of the public following this news very closely . This is up from two weeks prior when 38 % reported following news about the U.S. economy very closely and substantially higher than last fall when less than three-in-ten followed U.S. economic news very closely . The last time the condition of the U.S. economy drew this much attention was in February 1993 when 49 % of the public said they followed economic news very closely . The big economic news story last week was the buyout of Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns by J.P. Morgan Chase with the financial backing of the Federal Reserve . Almost half of the public said that they followed news about the buyout either very closely ( 21 % ) or fairly closely ( 26 % ) , but the story attracted far less interest than the condition of the U.S. economy in general ( 78 % very or fairly closely ) . Those in the top income tiers paid closer attention to news about the Bear Stearns buyout than did those with lower annual incomes . Among those earning $ 75,000 annually , 27 % reported following this story very closely compared to 17 % of those earning between $ 30,000 and $ 49,999 and 16 % of those earning less than $ 30,000 . Income differences do not affect the level of attention paid to the condition of the U.S. economy in general .
This increased attentiveness is carrying over into heightened interest in the debates . Six-in-ten voters ( 61 % ) say it is very likely they will watch the debates between Bush and Kerry , which is significantly higher than debate interest in the last two elections .
While sub-Saharan Africa had fewer religious restrictions in 2015 than many other parts of the world , it experienced a larger increase that year than any other region , according to a recent Pew Research Center report that tracks these restrictions by both governments and private individuals and groups . Attacks by the Nigeria-based extremist group Boko Haram , along with subsequent government reactions to those incidents , played a role in this increase .
A total of 38,901 Muslim refugees entered the U.S. in fiscal year 2016 , making up almost half ( 46 % ) of the nearly 85,000 refugees who entered the country in that period , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the State Department 's Refugee Processing Center . That means the U.S. has admitted the highest number of Muslim refugees of any year since data on self-reported religious affiliations first became publicly available in 2002 . Almost the same number of Christian ( 37,521 ) as Muslim refugees were admitted in fiscal 2016 , which ended Sept. 30 . A slightly lower share of 2016 's refugees were Christian ( 44 % ) than Muslim , the first time that has happened since fiscal 2006 , when a large number of Somali refugees entered the U.S .
Public views of the Supreme Court are little changed since last summer , following the court 's ruling in the Hobby Lobby case and other end-of-term decisions . Currently , half of Americans ( 50 % ) have a favorable opinion of the Supreme Court , while 39 % say they have an unfavorable view .
A median of 25 % across the 10 European countries polled say France plays a more important role in the world . Views that France 's global position has remained the same are widespread . A plurality in eight of 10 countries say France plays as important a role as it did 10 years ago .
Pew Research Center estimates that there were about 3.3 million Muslims of all ages living in the United States in 2015 . This means that Muslims made up about 1 % of the total U.S. population ( about 322 million people in 2015 ) , and we estimate that that share will double by 2050 . Our new estimate of Muslims and other faiths is based on a demographic projection that models growth in the American Muslim population since our 2011 estimate and includes both adults and children . The projection uses data on age , fertility , mortality , migration and religious switching drawn from multiple sources , including the 2011 survey of Muslim Americans .
When it comes to the bilateral economic relationship , Americans , by a more than two-to-one margin , say economic ties are bad ( 68 % ) rather than good ( 30 % ) . And a quarter say economic relations are very bad .
For several weeks there have been concerns about possible ventilator shortages in hospitals with COVID-19 patients , and concerns that medical providers might need to make decisions on how to allocate ventilators if that occurred . Among the public , half ( 50 % ) say that , if a shortage occurs , the priority for critical care should be given to patients most in need at the moment , while nearly as many ( 45 % ) say the priority should be to patients who doctors think are most likely to recover with treatment . A majority ( 58 % ) of adults under age 30 say the priority in the case of limits on access to ventilators should be `` patients who doctors think are most likely to recover with treatment , which may mean more people survive but that some patients do n't receive treatments because they are older or sicker . '' By comparison , nearly six-in-ten adults ages 50 and older ( 57 % ) say the priority should be `` patients who are most in need at the moment , which may mean fewer people overall survive , but doctors do not deny treatments based on age or health status . '' There are also substantial differences in these views by religious affiliation . Roughly six-in-ten evangelical Protestants ( 60 % ) and those affiliated with historically black Protestant denominations ( 59 % ) say that the priority should be given to patients based on their need in the moment . Opinion leans in the same direction among Catholics ( 53 % say give priority to those most in need vs. 42 % who say give priority to those most likely to recover ) . Mainline Protestants are divided about evenly on this question , while most religiously unaffiliated respondents say patients who are most likely to recover with treatment should be given priority if ventilators are scarce ( 56 % ) .
The number of Americans hearing mostly bad news about the economy has fallen 12 points over the past month and 31 points since fears of a new recession intensified in August . Currently , 56 % say the news they are hearing about the economy is a mix of good and bad , while 36 % say the news is mostly bad . This is the first time since May that significantly more view news about the economy as mixed than mostly bad . As has been the case for the past three years , very few people ( 6 % currently ) say the news they are hearing about the economy is mostly good . Despite the improving perceptions of economic news , however , somewhat more say they are hearing mostly bad economic news today than did so at the start of the year ( 24 % in January ) .
Seniors , like any other demographic group , are not monolithic , and there are important distinctions in their tech adoption patterns , beginning with age itself . Internet use and broadband adoption among seniors each fall off notably starting at approximately age 75 . Some 68 % of Americans in their early 70s go online , and 55 % have broadband at home . By contrast , internet adoption falls to 47 % and broadband adoption falls to 34 % among 75 - 79 year olds .
Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents , 19 % of adults under 30 say there are other countries that are superior to the U.S . In contrast , just 4 % of Republicans 50 and older take this view . Views of how the U.S. compares with other countries have long been divided along partisan lines . But these differences have widened in recent years as Democrats have become more likely to say there are other countries that are better than the U.S . In telephone surveys , the share of Democrats saying this is higher than at any point since the question was first asked by Pew Research Center in 2011 , and there has been a corresponding decline in the share saying the U.S. stands above other nations . Views among Republicans and Republican leaners have held steadier . ( It 's important to note that there is a mode effect on this question . Regardless of partisan affiliation , Americans appear less likely to say the U.S. stands above other countries – and more likely to say other countries are better than the U.S. – in surveys conducted online than by phone . )
The shares of U.S. adults who say they use the internet , use social media , own a smartphone or own a tablet computer are all nearly identical to the shares who said so in 2016 . The share who say they have broadband internet service at home currently stands at 65 % – nearly identical to the 67 % who said this in a survey conducted in summer 2015 . And when it comes to desktop or laptop ownership , there has actually been a small dip in the overall numbers over the last two years – from 78 % in 2016 to 73 % today . A contributing factor behind this slowing growth is that parts of the population have reached near-saturation levels of adoption of some technologies . Put simply , in some instances there just are n't many non-users left . For example , nine-in-ten or more adults younger than 50 say they go online or own a smartphone . And a similar share of those in higher-income households have laptops or desktops .
The public 's views of immigrants ' impact on the U.S. vary across different aspects of American life . Views are most negative about the economy and crime : Half of U.S. adults say immigrants are making things worse in those areas . On the economy , 28 % say immigrants are making things better , while 20 % say they are not having much of an effect . On crime , by contrast , just 7 % say immigrants are making things better , while 41 % generally see no positive or negative impact of immigrants in the U.S. on crime . On other aspects of U.S. life , Americans are more likely to hold neutral views of the impact of immigrants . Some 45 % say immigrants are not having much effect on social and moral values , and 56 % say they are not having much effect on science and technology . But when it comes to food , music and the arts , about half ( 49 % ) of adults say immigrants are making things better .
About half of Sanders supporters ( 54 % ) prioritize pushing hard for policies that Democrats want over finding common ground with Republicans . Among all Democratic voters , just 35 % favor this approach .
There are similar differences among typology groups in opinions about more gays and lesbians raising children . While 40 % of Solid Liberals view this trend as good thing for society , just 9 % of Hard-Pressed Democrats and 10 % of New Coalition Democrats agree .
Our February-March 2007 survey shows this phenomenon proceeding apace . As the table below indicates , 65 % of home broadband users go online from home at least once per day to use the internet or check email , compared with 40 % for dialup users .
Opinions vary widely across the countries surveyed on whether religion plays a more or less important role compared with 20 years ago . Those saying religion is more important ranges from 7 % in Spain and 8 % in Japan to 83 % in Indonesia and 65 % in Nigeria . But overall , there is a strong correlation between those who see religion 's role in society growing and those who think religion is very important in their lives ( +0.73 ) .
A growing share of Hispanic households speaks only English at home . Overall , the number of Hispanics ( 31 million ) that speaks English has been growing , as is the share that speaks only English at home . U.S. Census Bureau projections show that by 2020 , one-third of Hispanics ages 5 and older will speak only English at home , up from 25 % today .
A new Pew Research Center analysis finds that 66 % of Americans own at least two digital devices – smartphone , desktop or laptop computer , or tablet – and 36 % own all three . The age group most likely to own multiple devices is 30- to 49-year-olds , half of whom report owning all three , according to our 2015 survey data .
The public continues to be critical of both political parties . Both parties ' favorability ratings are more negative than positive and fewer than half say either party has high ethical standards . Majorities also fault both for their approach to government spending . But as in the past , more say the Democratic Party `` cares about the middle class '' ( 57 % ) than say that about the Republican Party ( 42 % ) . And while 54 % say the Republican Party is `` too extreme , '' fewer ( 45 % ) say this phrase applies to the Democratic Party . The share saying the Democratic Party is too extreme has risen over the past year ( from 37 % ) while perceptions of the GOP have shown less change .
Despite its recent drop in economic growth and rise in unemployment and inflation , nearly eight-in-ten ( 79 % ) Czechs approved of the change from a state-controlled to a free market economy in the post-communist period . Of the other publics surveyed in the region , only east Germans ( 82 % ) rivaled Czechs in their support for free markets .
Despite gloomy national conditions , many say their personal economic situation is good . This is one area where the emerging markets are not alone in their positive attitudes – a median of 57 % among emerging market publics say things are going well personally , and a nearly equal percentage ( 58 % ) among the advanced economies feels good about their family finances . Publics in developing economies are somewhat less satisfied with their personal situation ( 47 % ) .
Today , a 57 % majority of Republicans and Republican leaners characterize national economic conditions as excellent ( 10 % ) or good ( 47 % ) . Among Democrats , just 30 % say the same . At the same time , Democrats are roughly twice as likely as Republicans to describe current conditions as poor ( 27 % vs. 12 % ) .
Notably , among the roughly one-quarter of Republicans who say the Trump administration 's approach to Iran has raised chances of a military conflict , most ( 65 % ) say the decision to conduct the airstrike was the right one . Only about a third of Republicans ( 31 % ) who say Trump 's approach has raised the likelihood of a military conflict with Iran say it was the wrong decision . These differences extend to views of the Trump administration 's overall approach toward Iran . A majority of women ( 62 % ) say the administration 's approach to Iran has increased the likelihood of a major military conflict ; about half of men ( 47 % ) say the same .
History break : As McDonald 's chart shows , in the early decades of the republic , midterm elections typically drew more voters than presidential contests . Back then , most states only gave voting rights to property owners , and Congress — not the presidency — tended to be the federal government 's main power center and focus of electoral campaigns . Those conditions changed in the 1820s during the Second Party System , when most states repealed property qualifications , interest in politics soared as politicians increasingly appealed to ordinary people , and the parties directed much of their energy on capturing the White House after the disputed 1824 election ( which John Quincy Adams won even though Andrew Jackson received the most votes ) . By 1840 , turnout among the white , male electorate topped 80 % ; the total number of votes cast that year was 60 % higher than in 1836 . ( Blacks received the right to vote in 1870 with the Fifteenth Amendment , women in 1920 with the Nineteenth Amendment . )
As the first 2020 primaries and caucuses near , the vast majority of Latino registered voters who are Democrats or lean toward the party see the 2020 presidential election results as of particular importance , and over half have a good or excellent impression of their own party 's candidates , according to a national Pew Research Center survey of Latino adults conducted in December . When asked about candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination , a majority of Latino Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they have a good ( 54 % ) or excellent ( 11 % ) impression of them . A third say they have an only fair ( 28 % ) or poor ( 5 % ) impression of the candidates . These views are on par with those among all Democratic and Democratic leaning registered voters in September 2019 on the American Trends Panel .
Only , in neighboring Canada does a 53 % -majority describe Americans as rude . Interestingly , Americans themselves are more likely to assign that negative characteristic to their fellow countrymen ( 35 % do so ) than are the residents of Great Britain ( 29 % ) , the Netherlands ( 26 % ) and Poland ( 21 % ) . And a scant 12 % of Germans find Americans lacking in politeness . Looking farther around the globe , however , one finds other countries that share Canada 's reservations with regard to American gentility . ( See chart below ) . In Turkey , an identical 53 % see Americans as rude . This view is shared by larger majorities in Indonesia ( 56 % ) and Jordan ( 64 % ) .
More young adults in the U.S. are living with their parents than at any time since around 1940 , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of census data . This trend is not , as you might assume , solely a consequence of the 2007 - 09 Great Recession , nor is it limited to the U.S. Across much of the developed world , researchers have noted that more young adults are living at their parents ' homes for longer periods – in some cases because they never left , in others because they moved back after being on their own in college or the working world .
Interestingly , the French also were most likely to support cutting government spending as a solution to its economic problems , according to the spring global attitudes survey by the Pew Research Center : 81 % of the French public said they preferred cuts rather than trying to stimulate the economy through increasing government spending . That was the highest support level for cuts among eight European countries ( the only ones in the global survey that were asked that question ) .
Throughout most of the last decade , the generational gap within white evangelicals was more modest . In 2007 , for instance , 12 % of Boomer and Silent white evangelicals supported same-sex marriage , compared with 19 % of Millennial and Gen Xer white evangelicals .
By the time of the November 2008 presidential election , the decision-split registered at 39 % right versus 50 % wrong . As the public 's view of the progress of the military effort improved , the number judging the decision to have been correct rose marginally to 43 % by the time of Barack Obama 's inauguration in January 2009 ( as shown in the chart on the right ) . By contrast , a hefty 64 % approved of the decision to use force in Afghanistan , the subject of relatively little media coverage or official pronouncements compared with the conflict in Iraq .
The political and economic contexts in which people live help explain differences in state-level support for stricter environmental regulations . States that voted for Democratic candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election are more likely to say that stricter environmental regulations are worth the cost . For example , nearly seven-in-ten adults in Hawaii ( 68 % ) and Vermont ( 70 % ) hold this view , and both are states that backed Obama in the 2012 election by a wide margin . By contrast , those in states that voted for Republican candidate Mitt Romney in 2012 are more divided about the trade-off between the economy and environmental regulation . State economic conditions are another factor . People living in wealthier states where per capita incomes are higher , such as New Jersey , Massachusetts and Connecticut , tend to see environmental regulations as worth the cost . By comparison , those in poorer states such as Mississippi and Alabama are more inclined to see environmental regulations as costing too many jobs and hurting the economy .
This comes at a time when support for same-sex marriage has been on the rise . Across four Pew Research Center surveys this year , 48 % of Americans say they favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally , while 43 % are opposed . Just four years ago , in the 2008 election cycle , 51 % opposed making same-sex marriages legal and 39 % supported it .
Overall , 24 % of teens who report being constantly online say they meet with their friends in person outside of school every day or almost every day . That is nearly identical to the 23 % of less-frequently online teens who say they see their friends almost daily . And when it comes to online interaction with their friends , 69 % of teens who are online constantly say they talk to their friends online every day or almost every day , compared with 52 % of teens who visit the internet less frequently .
The divide over health care fits a broader pattern of growing partisan disagreement over the role and effectiveness of government . For example , the values study shows that Republicans have become much less supportive over the past 25 years of the notion that government should help those in need , while Democratic attitudes are little changed . ( See full slideshow of findings . )
First , split-ticket districts were overwhelmingly Republican for the presidency but Democratic when it came to the House ( a combined 92.6 % of all split-ticket districts in the five election cycles between 1972 and 1988 ) . And second , tickets in Southern districts were far more likely to be split than those in any other region : Of all districts that split their presidential and House votes between 1972 and 1988 , 41.2 % were from Southern states even though the South accounted for just 31.5 % of all House seats . This was well above the shares in any of the other three Census-defined regions . In 1972 , two-thirds of all Southern districts split their presidential and House votes ; as recently as 1988 more than half still did .
The U.S. is by far Canada 's largest trading partner , accounting for $ 707 billion in goods and private services trade between the two countries in 2012 . When asked whether it is more important to have strong economic ties with China or the U.S. , 73 % of Canadians choose the U.S. Only 13 % would favor stronger economic ties with China . Despite these sentiments , Canadians tend to believe that China , and not the U.S. , is the world 's leading economic power . A 46 % plurality of Canadians say that China is the top economy , while just 34 % name the U.S. French-speaking Canadians ( 58 % ) and followers of the NDP ( 57 % ) are more likely to name China as the world 's leading economy , compared with English speakers ( 43 % ) and both Liberals ( 44 % ) and CPC supporters ( 40 % ) .
Similarly , over the entire course of 2010 1 % of news coverage was devoted to Iraq events and policy debates , and in no week did Iraq consume more than 10 % of the newshole . Public interest in Iraq news was also modest – in the ten weeks in which public interest in Iraq-related news was tested , roughly a quarter of Americans said they were following `` very closely '' , but about one-in-ten rated it as the top story they followed most closely . The exception to this came in early September , when 17 % said they were following news about the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq more closely than any other story .
For the first time , the number of 18- to 24-year-old Hispanics enrolled in college exceeded 2 million and reached a record 16.5 % share of all college enrollments . 2 Hispanics are the largest minority group on the nation 's college campuses , a milestone first achieved last year ( Fry , 2011 ) . But as their growth among all college-age students continues to outpace other groups , Hispanics are now , for the first time , the largest minority group among the nation 's four-year college and university students . And for the first time , Hispanics made up one-quarter ( 25.2 % ) of 18- to 24-year-old students enrolled in two-year colleges .
The Russian public feels confident about their country 's global standing , according to a new Pew Research Center survey , even as signs of discontent emerge at home . Here are four key findings about how Russians see their nation 's place in the world : A majority of Russians believe their country is playing a more important role in the world today than it did a decade ago . Other publics with a sense of growing global importance include China and India . In a spring 2016 survey , three-quarters of Chinese and 68 % of Indians said their country is more influential compared with a decade ago . Such confidence contrasts with European views , where a median of just 23 % across 10 European Union nations felt their country 's global influence was on the rise in 2016 .
In 2010 , women made up almost half of the labor force ( 46.7 % ) . In 1997 , women made up 46.2 % of the labor force , and back in 1970 women made up only 38.1 % of the labor force . On the education front , women have made substantial strides in recent decades and now surpass men in both college enrollment and completion . Some 44 % of women ages 18 to 24 were enrolled in college or graduate programs as of October 2010 , compared with just 38 % of men in the same age group .
Although the GOP now controls both the House and Senate , Republicans and Democrats hold similar views of Congress : 29 % of Democrats and 28 % of Republicans rate it favorably . By comparison , Democratic ratings of Congress were consistently higher than Republicans ' ratings when Democrats controlled both chambers from 2007 to 2010 . Independents ' opinions of Congress are more negative than those in either party . Just 22 % say they have a favorable view of Congress , relatively unchanged in recent months .
Drought tops the list of climate change concerns . We read respondents a list of four potential effects of global warming , and asked which one concerns them the most : droughts or water shortages ; severe weather , such as floods or intense storms ; long periods of unusually hot weather ; or rising sea levels . In 31 nations , drought is a top worry . Fully half of Americans name drought as their chief climate change concern , and this is especially true in drought-plagued Western states compared with other regions of the country .
Since 2012 , about 800,000 such renewals have been issued . Requests for renewals have increased significantly each quarter since spring 2016 – from about 16,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 to about 122,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 – as an increasing number of program participants have become eligible to renew their benefits for another two years . Halfway through fiscal 2017 , more than 200,000 unauthorized immigrants have renewed their benefits so far . ( The latest government data include the first two quarters of fiscal year 2017 , through March 31 ; the full fiscal year ends Sept . 30 . )
Democrats rate their party better than Republicans when it comes to representing their views on the issue of illegal immigration . About half ( 51 % ) of Democrats and Democratic leaners say their party is doing a good job representing their views . Just 34 % of Republicans and Republican leaners say this about the GOP . Overall , 83 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners support a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants . Among this group , 55 % say the party is doing a good job representing their views on this issue ; 38 % say it is not . Democrats who oppose a path to legal status ( 16 % of all Democrats and Democratic leaners ) are more critical of their party : Just 30 % say the party does a good job of reflecting their views , while 70 % say it does not . On the Republican side , both supporters and opponents of legal status for undocumented immigrants think the GOP is not doing a good job representing their views . Republicans and Republican leaners who oppose legal status are somewhat more negative about the party on this issue ( 65 % bad job vs. 30 % good job ) than those who support a pathway to legal status ( 55 % bad vs. 36 % good ) .
This survey finds that about a third of Americans ( 35 % ) register low levels of trust in other people , compared with 29 % who are `` high trusters '' and 32 % who are `` medium trusters . ''
Yet there are virtually no partisan differences today in concerns over obesity : 71 % of Democrats and 69 % of Republicans say it is an extremely or very serious public health problem . Four years ago , 77 % of Democrats said it was at least very serious problem , compared with 60 % of Republicans .
About a quarter ( 23 % ) say they very closely followed news about the release of lions , tigers and other animals from a private wild animal farm in Ohio . Police killed most of the animals , fearing they could hurt humans if not put down quickly . This news made up 4 % of the coverage analyzed by PEJ . About two-in-ten ( 21 % ) say they very closely followed news last week about the candidates for the 2012 presidential elections . As has been the case in recent weeks , Republicans tracked this news more closely than Democrats or independents . Nearly four-in-ten Republicans ( 37 % ) say they followed campaign news very closely , compared with 20 % of Democrats and 16 % of independents . About two-in-ten ( 19 % ) say they very closely followed news about the anti-Wall Street protests in New York and other cities . This was the top story for 9 % . Comparable numbers of Democrats , Republicans and independents say they followed this news very closely ( 23 % , 19 % and 17 % , respectively ) . Coverage dropped from 10 % two weeks ago to 4 % this past week .
For many in emerging and developing nations , online political dialogue leads to discoveries about the political leanings of people they know . In nine countries , half or more of social networkers say they have learned that someone 's political beliefs were different than they thought , based on something that person posted on a site like Facebook or Twitter . This type of discovery is particularly common in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America . It happens less often in Egypt , China , Jordan and Turkey .
Former Sen. Tom Daschle 's decision to withdraw from consideration to be President Obama 's secretary for health and human services over a tax controversy attracted the very close interest of one-in-four Americans . For 5 % of the public , this was their top story of the week . The elections in Iraq received considerably less interest from the American public than the first time Iraqis went to the polls in February , 2005 . Just 7 % say they followed the Iraqi elections very closely last week , while a 40 % plurality say they did not follow these elections closely at all . That compares with a significantly greater percentage – 27 % – that followed the Iraqi elections very closely in early 2005 . According to the Project for Excellence in Journalism 's content analysis , just 2 % of news coverage was devoted to the Iraqi elections last week .
These political orientations appear to serve as an anchoring point for how knowledge influences peoples ' attitudes . This pattern is consistent with an array of scholarly literature which suggests that people 's political worldviews shape how science knowledge influences attitudes on climate-related matters . People 's level of science knowledge helps to a degree to explain their beliefs about climate change , but the relationship is complicated . While there are wide political divides in public views of the potential for harm from climate change . A majority of Democrats holding medium or high levels of science knowledge said it was `` very likely '' that climate change would lead to rising sea levels that erode beaches and shore lines , harm to animal wildlife and their habitats , damage to forests and plant life , storms that are more severe , and more droughts or water shortages . But there are no differences or only modest differences among Republicans holding high , medium and low science knowledge levels in their expectations of harms to the Earth 's ecosystems because of climate change .
For 18 of 19 programs tested , majorities want either to increase spending or maintain it at current levels . The only exception is assistance for needy people around the world . Nonetheless , as many say that funding for aid to the needy overseas should either be increased ( 21 % ) , or kept the same ( 28 % ) , as decreased ( 48 % ) .
There are differences in the amount of online instruction parents say their children have received during the coronavirus-related closures . Some 43 % of parents say their children 's K-12 school has provided a lot of online instruction since it closed , while 35 % say the school has provided some . ( Online instruction can include online assignments , meetings with teachers or instructional videos . )
The public is divided over the best approach to confronting global terrorism . Overall , 45 % say `` using overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world , '' while about as many ( 46 % ) say `` relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism creates hatred that leads to more terrorism . ''
Recent attacks in Paris , Beirut and Baghdad linked to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) have once again brought terrorism and Islamic extremism to the forefront of international relations . According to newly released data that the Pew Research Center collected in 11 countries with significant Muslim populations , people from Nigeria to Jordan to Indonesia overwhelmingly expressed negative views of ISIS .
Analysis of the survey shows that judgments of the way Bush is handling the situation in Iraq is a strong factor in attitudes toward his reelection , while opinions of the decision to go to war are not particularly crucial . This marks a significant change since mid-April , when opinion about the decision to go to war drove voting intentions more than views of the president 's handling of the war . The analysis also shows that the president 's approval rating on handling terrorism , which remain strong at 64 % , is not as important a factor in attitudes toward his reelection .
The survey finds that Republican voters continue to give their field of presidential candidates higher ratings than at comparable points during the last two presidential campaigns . Meanwhile , Democratic voters are less positive about their party 's field than at about the same point in 2007 , the last election in which the party had a contested nomination . Nearly six-in-ten ( 59 % ) Republican and Republican leaning voters say they have an excellent or good impression of their party 's presidential candidates , which is little changed from May of this year ( 57 % ) . In August 2011 , 49 % of Republican voters viewed the GOP presidential field positively ; in October 2007 , 50 % had a favorable impression of the candidates as a group .
Majorities say Trump definitely or probably has not set a high moral standard for the presidency ( 70 % say this ) , improved the way government works ( 66 % ) , improved the country 's standing around the world ( 63 % ) and run an open and transparent administration ( 61 % ) . In addition , 56 % say Trump has definitely or probably used his office to enrich himself , or his friends and family . There is somewhat more variance in Republicans ' views . While three-quarters of Republicans say Trump has run an open and transparent administration ( 75 % ) and improved U.S. standing around the world ( 72 % ) , a smaller majority ( 57 % ) say he has set a high moral standard for the presidency . And while most Republicans say Trump has not improperly used the office of the presidency to enrich himself or others , 23 % say he definitely or probably has done this .
Since the early 1990s , as The Economist chart above shows , Olympics organizers have steadily added more and more freestyle skiing , snowboarding and other X Games-style events in a bid to appeal to younger viewers . At Sochi , according to the magazine , 20 of the 98 official events are `` cool . '' ( Wondering what all those mid-air spins and flips are all about ? The New York Times asked several athletes to explain their tricks . )
Among respondents who took the survey from March 3 - 12 , before the declaration of a national emergency and the suspension of most professional and collegiate sports seasons , 73 % said the spread of infectious diseases was a major threat . But once the declaration was made on March 13 , as cases of the novel coronavirus increased across the U.S. , more became concerned about the issue . Among those surveyed between March 13 - 29 , 84 % named spreading disease as a major threat .
Knowledge of QAnon varies based on the social media platform used in the past week for election news . For example , people who got news from Reddit or Twitter are most likely to say they 've heard or read a lot ( 8 % and 6 % , respectively ) or a little ( 39 % of Reddit users and 31 % of Twitter users ) about the conspiracy theories . Those who got news from YouTube are also more likely than Americans overall to have heard or read a lot ( 6 % ) or a little ( 27 % ) about QAnon .
But graduates still out-earn people without degrees . A Pew Research Center report from earlier this year looked at earnings of Millennials ( those born after 1980 ) who usually worked full-time in 2012 . Among that group , workers with at least a bachelor 's degree had median annual earnings of $ 45,500 , well over the medians for people with only some college ( $ 30,000 ) or a high-school diploma ( $ 28,000 ) . The gap has widened over the years and across the generations : In 1965 , when the members of the Silent Generation were 25 to 34 years old , median earnings for high-school graduates were 81 % of those for college graduates ; in 2013 , among the Millennials , it was 61.5 % .
Changes were much less dramatic for other hate-crime motives tracked by the government . Hate crimes in which race and sexual orientation were cited showed a decline between 2004 and 2012 , from 58 % to 46 % , while hate crimes motivated by a person 's disability remained about the same ( 11 % ) . The BJS noted that in many cases , victims reported more than one bias motivation for the same crime .
The National Day of Prayer , established by Congress in 1952 , occurs on May 7 this year . The U.S . Religious Landscape Survey , conducted by the Pew Research Center 's Forum on Religion & Public Life , shows that prayer is a common religious practice in America , with nearly six-in-ten adults in the U.S. saying they pray at least once a day . However , frequency of prayer differs significantly by religious tradition , age , gender and income .
As the Obama administration announces new economic measures against Russian officials and companies , the public supports increased U.S. economic and diplomatic sanctions by a 53 % to 36 % margin . But by roughly two-to-one ( 62 % to 30 % ) , Americans oppose sending arms and military supplies to the Ukrainian government .
An estimated 940,000 Hispanics of Honduran origin lived in the United States in 2017 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey . Hondurans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Honduran origin ; this includes immigrants from Honduras and those who trace their family ancestry to Honduras . Hondurans are the eighth-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States , accounting for 2 % of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017 . Since 2000 , the Honduran-origin population has increased 296 % , growing from 237,000 to 940,000 over the period . At the same time , the Honduran foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 215 % , from 184,000 in 2000 to 579,000 in 2017 . By comparison , Mexicans , the nation 's largest Hispanic origin group , constituted 36.6 million , or 62 % , of the Hispanic population in 2017 .
Canada resettled more refugees than the United States in 2018 , the first time the U.S. did not lead the world on this measure since the adoption of the Refugee Act in 1980 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) . Canada resettled 28,000 refugees last year , similar to its total in 2017 . Meanwhile , the U.S. resettled 23,000 , down from 33,000 the previous year – and a recent high of 97,000 in 2016 . Several other leading countries for refugee resettlement , including Australia and the United Kingdom , also saw declines last year .
There are demographic differences in who identifies as LGBT . The most notable is by age . Young adults , ages 18 to 36 , are by far the most likely to identify as LGBT ( 7.3 % ) . By contrast , much smaller shares of those ages 37 to 51 ( 3.2 % ) , 52 to 70 ( 2.4 % ) and 71 and older ( 1.4 % ) say they are LGBT , according to Gallup . Some 4.4 % of women and 3.7 % of men identify as LGBT . Whites are somewhat less likely ( 3.6 % ) than blacks ( 4.6 % ) , Hispanics ( 5.4 % ) and Asians ( 4.9 % ) to say they are LGBT .
And who 's responsible for the difficulties of the middle class ? While Congress gets the most votes , with 62 % assigning it `` a lot '' of the blame , the Pew Research report found plenty of blame to go around . The one exception : Middle-class people themselves , with just 8 % assigning their own socioeconomic group `` a lot '' of blame , and 47 % saying they were n't to blame at all .
Most say Trump is arrogant , intolerant and dangerous , but a majority also sees him as a strong leader . Survey respondents were read a list of positive and negative characteristics and asked whether each one describes Trump . Around the globe , people tend to associate the American leader with all of the negative characteristics tested : Most say he is arrogant , intolerant and dangerous , while relatively few think of him as well-qualified or as someone who cares about ordinary people . Describing Trump as charismatic is more common , though global publics on balance do not think of him as charismatic , either . They do , however , see Trump as a strong leader – a median of 55 % across the nations polled describe him this way .
This view is particularly widespread in Western Europe , where more than eight-in-ten in France ( 91 % ) , Spain ( 91 % ) and Germany ( 85 % ) agree that the preferred marital model is one where husband and wife share a family 's financial burden as well as the household and child care responsibilities . More than eight-in-ten in Brazil ( 84 % ) and Kenya ( 81 % ) and at least three-quarters in China ( 78 % ) and Mexico ( 76 % ) share this view . Across predominantly Muslim countries , support for both spouses working is mixed . About nine-in-ten in Lebanon ( 92 % ) favor a double-income household and an egalitarian approach to tasks at home , as do 72 % in Turkey . In Indonesia , the majority in favor of dual workers both inside and outside the home is narrower ( 56 % ) , with 43 % of Indonesians saying that a marriage where the husband provides for the family and the wife takes care of the house and children is preferable . Egyptians and Jordanians are more divided ; 48 % and 47 % , respectively , embrace the egalitarian approach to marriage , while about four-in-ten ( 38 % in Egypt and 40 % in Jordan ) choose a more traditional arrangement . In contrast , Pakistanis are overwhelmingly of the opinion that a marriage where the husband bears the financial responsibility while the wife cares for the house and children is more satisfying ; nearly eight-in-ten ( 79 % ) share this view , compared with just 18 % of Pakistanis who favor a non-traditional approach .
An estimated 810,000 Hispanics with origins from Spain – that is , those who are immigrants from or who trace their family ancestry to Spain – resided in the United States in 2017 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey . Spaniards in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics with origins from Spain . Spaniards are the ninth-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States , accounting for 1 % of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017 . Since 2010 , the population with origins from Spain has increased 15 % , growing from 707,000 to 810,000 over the period . At the same time , the foreign-born population with origins from Spain living in the U.S. grew by 41 % , from 91,000 in 2010 to 129,000 in 2017 . By comparison , Mexicans , the nation 's largest Hispanic origin group , constituted 36.6 million , or 62 % , of the Hispanic population in 2017 .
The sharpest falloff during that period came among moderate and liberal Republicans . Just 27 % of moderates and liberals expressed a favorable view , down 19 points from the previous June . The Tea Party 's ratings declined even among conservatives , from 74 % favorable in June of that year to 65 % in October .
The ATUS not only asks people how they spend their time but also how they feel while they 're engaged in particular activities . Our analysis of this data shows that mothers find their leisure time to be more meaningful than do fathers . Mothers rate 63 % of their leisure activities `` very meaningful , '' while fathers give a similar rating to about 52 % of their leisure activities . Meanwhile , mothers feel more exhausted than fathers during their leisure time , and their stress level associated with leisure time is higher as well .
When asked specifically about Kashmir , a majority of Indians ( 55 % ) see the situation there as a very big problem . More than half ( 53 % ) say circumstances in Kashmir have gotten worse over the last five years , and a majority ( 58 % ) believes the Indian government should use more military force than it uses currently in dealing with tensions in the area .
The Pew Research survey asked a question about the role of astronauts in the future as part of space exploration : `` The cost of sending human astronauts to space is considerably greater than the cost of using robotic machines for space exploration . As you think about the future of the U.S. space program , do you think it is essential or not essential to include the use of human astronauts in space ? '' A majority of the public ( 59 % ) says astronauts are essential to include in the future of the U.S. space program , while 39 % say astronauts are not essential . By contrast , 52 % of AAAS scientists say astronauts are not essential and 47 % say they are essential . Men are a bit more likely than women to consider astronauts essential in the future of the U.S. space program . There are no differences in views about this issue by age , race and ethnicity , or education .
Several other policing proposals draw broad support as well : 90 % of the public favors a federal government database to track officers accused of misconduct . Three-quarters support giving civilian oversight boards the power to investigate and discipline officers accused of misconduct , and similar shares favor requiring officers to live in the places they police and outlawing police use of chokeholds or strangleholds .
Among the 44 % of Republican and Republican-leaning voters who have heard of Cain , 39 % say there is a good chance they would vote for him , while 35 % say there is some chance . Nearly twice as many Republican voters have heard of Romney ( 85 % ) . Among this group , 32 % say there is a good chance they would vote for him and 43 % say there is some chance .
A new Pew Research Center survey finds that 54 % of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters think disagreements within the party will keep many Republicans from supporting Trump . Fewer ( 38 % ) think the party will solidly unite behind him .
Overall , more Americans perceive fact-checkers as fair than say the same of news organizations more generally – but news organizations , too , elicit sharply divergent views from members of the two parties . Roughly seven-in-ten Americans ( 72 % ) say news organizations tend to favor one side when covering political and social issues – notably higher than the half who say the same about fact-checkers . Republicans are 32 points more likely than Democrats to have this view , though majorities of both parties say this ( 89 % of Republicans vs. 57 % of Democrats ) , and again , independents fall in between ( 72 % ) . The partisan difference on this question is on par with the prior two years it has been asked , and is larger than at any time in the previous three decades except in 2007 , at the end of President George W. Bush 's second term in office .
As they have since 2009 , about three-fifths of Mexicans ( 61 % ) say they would n't move to the United States even if they had the means and opportunity to do so . However , a sizable minority ( 35 % ) say they would move to the U.S. if they could , including 20 % who say they would emigrate without authorization . Read more
Trump 's key foreign policies are unpopular . When asked in the spring and summer of 2019 about six of Trump 's key foreign policies , people around the world largely expressed disapproval . They are especially critical of his tariff policy and the withdrawal from climate change agreements such as the Paris Agreement . Trump 's immigration policies , including his well-known plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border , are also unpopular , with a few exceptions in Central and Eastern Europe and Israel . People also see Trump 's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear weapons agreement negatively but are more positive about his negotiations with Kim Jong Un over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program . ( The survey was conducted prior to the Jan. 3 , 2020 , U.S. missile strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani . ) Trump 's restrictions on immigration are more popular among those who support right-wing populist parties in Europe . When asked whether they approve of Trump 's policy to allow fewer immigrants in the U.S. , people who support National Rally in France , Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) in Germany and Sweden Democrats in Sweden are at least 40 percentage points more likely than nonsupporters to express approval . This stark difference between populist supporters and non-populist supporters appears in many European countries and extends to opinions about Trump himself , as well as to his policy of building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico .
Gasoline and energy prices are far and away the most talked about issues among Americans today . Three-quarters say that it is a subject that comes up `` frequently '' in conversations with family and friends , and it is a topic of discussion among people of all walks of life and political persuasions . The economy , the war in Iraq , education , and health care are also frequent topics of conversation for most Americans . Far fewer have regular conversations about government corruption , Social Security or the environment , and just 14 % say the topic of gay marriage comes up frequently .
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center , conducted March 25 - 29 among 1,500 adults , finds little recent change in overall favorability of labor unions : 48 % hold a favorable view of unions , while somewhat fewer ( 39 % ) say they have an unfavorable view . Opinions of unions have recovered from lows reached in 2010 and 2011 .
The wealth of white households was 13 times the median wealth of black households in 2013 , compared with eight times the wealth in 2010 , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of data from the Federal Reserve 's Survey of Consumer Finances . Likewise , the wealth of white households is now more than 10 times the wealth of Hispanic households , compared with nine times the wealth in 2010 .
Large majorities of the public know that Afghanistan and Pakistan share a border and can identify Hillary Clinton in a photograph as the nation 's secretary of state , according to the Pew Research Center 's latest News IQ survey , which for the first time includes visual questions . While majorities answer most of the 19 questions correctly , some prove more difficult . About four-in-ten , for example , know that Republicans now hold a majority only in the House of Representatives or can identify the crescent and star from four visual choices as the symbol associated with Islam . Seven of the 10 items with the most correct answers are visual questions . In addition to the large majority ( 82 % ) that correctly pick a photo of Hillary Clinton from four when asked which showed the current secretary of State , 79 % select the name `` Moammar Gadhafi '' from a list of four when shown a photo of the former Libyan leader . On a map of South America with four nations numbered and highlighted , 77 % correctly identify Brazil .
While the Arab Spring developments in Egypt generated strong public interest early in the year , the Oct. 20 death of Moammar Gadhafi in Libya attracted much less attention . That week , 13 % said the death of the former Libyan leader was the news they followed most closely . Public interest was divided among five top stories , none followed most closely by more than 15 % . Gadhafi 's death , which came after rebels had taken control of the Libyan government , accounted for 17 % of coverage that week .
Two foreign policy stories rounded out the news index for the week . The historic talks between the United States and Iran regarding the situation in Iraq were followed very closely by 19 % of the public . Only 3 % said this was the story they followed most closely . Interest in U.S.-Iranian relations was higher in February of this year when tensions were mounting between the two nations . Darfur was back in the news last week as President Bush announced that the U.S. would impose new sanctions against Sudan . Only 12 % of the public followed news about Darfur very closely and 2 % listed this as their most closely followed story . However , there are signs that the public would like to hear more about the violence in Darfur . When asked whether news organizations are giving too much , too little , or the right amount of coverage to ethnic violence in Darfur , a plurality of the public ( 49 % ) , says the issue is getting too little coverage . Only 10 % say Darfur has gotten too much coverage and 27 % say it has gotten the right amount of coverage .
While on balance people in these nations express largely positive judgments about the personal and societal impact of technologies , they also express significant concerns over the effects mobile phones and online connectivity might have on young people . Worries that mobile phones might expose children to immoral or harmful content are a key flashpoint in these fears . A median of 79 % of adults in these 11 countries – and majorities in all countries surveyed – say people should be very concerned about this . More broadly , a median of 54 % say the increasing use of the internet has had a bad influence on children in their country , and a median of 63 % say the same about mobile phones . Coupled with these concerns , many parents say they try to be vigilant about what their children are doing and seeing on their phones .3 Among parents whose children have mobile phones , a median of 50 % say they monitor what their children do on their mobile devices . Parents who are themselves smartphone or social media users are more likely than non-users to monitor their child 's phone in this way . Along with monitoring their children 's activities on their mobile devices , a median of 52 % of parents whose children have mobile phones have tried to limit the time their children spend with their phones .
Voters are concerned that lawmakers will not strike the right balance in overseeing the Trump administration – no matter which party prevails . A majority of voters ( 64 % ) say if Republicans keep control of Congress , they are very or somewhat concerned that the GOP will not focus enough on oversight of the administration . A smaller majority ( 55 % ) are concerned that if the Democrats take control of Congress , they will focus too much on investigating the Trump administration . These opinions remain deeply divided along partisan lines .
Tensions at the official level are reflected in German public opini0n . In a spring 2017 Pew Research Center poll , only 11 % of Germans said they had confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs . A year earlier , 86 % had expressed confidence in Trump 's predecessor , Barack Obama . The change in American leadership has led to a shift in overall ratings for the U.S. in Germany . Just 35 % of Germans had a favorable opinion of the U.S. in 2017 , down from 57 % in 2016 . ( For more on declining ratings for the U.S. globally , see `` U.S . Image Suffers as Publics Around World Question Trump 's Leadership . '' )
Overall , Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was mentioned more frequently than any other candidate in May , June and September of 2015 . Sanders was mentioned in about 165,000 comments , more than the number of mentions for the next two highest candidates combined : former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , with about 85,000 , and Donald Trump , with about 73,000 . The main Sanders discussion forum , or subreddit , /r/SandersForPresident , offered not only discussion but opportunities to volunteer and raise funds for the candidate .
A 2012 Pew Research poll showed that a plurality of U.S. Catholics ( 45 % ) said getting a divorce was not a moral issue ; 32 % of U.S. Catholics say it was morally acceptable , while 19 % said it was morally wrong . There were not significant differences on this question between Catholics who say they attend Mass at least once a week and those who attend church less often .
This gap in use between foreign-born Hispanics and U.S.-born Hispanics , whites and blacks may reflect foreign-born Hispanics ' views of the relative ease of using public libraries . According to the survey , just one-third of immigrant Hispanics say they would find it `` very easy '' to visit a public library in person if they wanted to do so . By comparison , 60 % of U.S.-born Hispanics , 67 % of whites and 59 % of blacks say it would be very easy to visit a public library in person .
By and large , House special elections are low-turnout events . Excluding the 20 special elections held concurrently with regular elections , turnout in the House special elections we examined was , on average , about half that of the previous general election in the same district . The most extreme case occurred in November 2008 , when a special election was held to fill the remaining weeks in Democratic Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones ' term representing Ohio 's 11th District . Democrat Marcia Fudge had already won the regular election for the incoming Congress two weeks earlier , when nearly 250,000 voters cast ballots ; Fudge was unopposed in the separate special election , and just 8,844 people voted ( 8,597 of them for Fudge ) . States sometimes will schedule a special election for the same day as the regular election , partly to save on the expense of holding a separate election and partly to give the winner a bit of a seniority boost ( because they can take their seats immediately , rather than waiting till January for the new Congress to convene ) . In such cases special election turnout is much higher , relatively speaking : In the 20 cases of concurrent special and general elections that we analyzed , turnout in the special elections averaged just 4.2 % below the concurrent general elections . In three instances , in fact , more people voted in the special election than in the concurrent general . ( In only five of the non-concurrent special elections did turnout exceed the previous general election , which in each case featured a longtime incumbent who seldom if ever faced serious opposition ) .
However , the public is more divided about whether the NATO alliance is more important to the United States or other NATO countries . A plurality of the public ( 42 % ) says NATO is about as important to the U.S. as it is to other NATO countries . About a third ( 34 % ) say the alliance is more important to other NATO countries , while just 15 % say it is more important to the U.S .
Islamic extremism continues to be a serious concern in nations with substantial Muslim populations . Large majorities in five of the six predominantly Muslim nations surveyed as well as in Nigeria , where roughly half of the population is Muslim , say they are very or somewhat concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world . The only outlier is Turkey , where 39 % are concerned . Many are also worried about the rise of Islamic extremism within their own countries . That is especially the case in Lebanon , where eight-in-ten – including 90 % of Christians , 82 % of Shia and 67 % of Sunnis – express at least some concern . In Nigeria , roughly three-quarters ( 76 % ) are concerned about Islamic extremism in their country , including 83 % of Muslims and 68 % of Christians . Nearly two-thirds of Pakistanis ( 65 % ) express concern about Islamic extremism in their country , but fears have declined since last year , when 79 % shared that view . About six-in-ten in Egypt ( 61 % ) and Indonesia ( 59 % ) and more than four-in-ten in Jordan ( 44 % ) and Turkey ( 43 % ) are also concerned about extremism in their countries .
When Barack Obama took office , 7.6 % of Americans were unemployed ( nearly identical to the unemployment rate Reagan inherited some 30 years earlier ) . As with Reagan , a rising joblessness appears to have taken a substantial toll on the president 's job approval ratings . From a post-inauguration high of 64 % , Obama 's approval rating fell to roughly 50 % by the end of the year as unemployment rose to 10.0 % . As the past 30 years have shown , shifts in the public 's judgments about presidential performance are not always the product of rising or falling unemployment rates ; other factors can intervene . However , there is nothing now on the horizon that seems likely to diminish the impact that unemployment is having on views of Obama . His situation continues to parallel Reagan 's , whose ratings recovered only when jobless rates began to decline .
Because of this , about nine-in-ten ( 92 % ) Americans who agree with the Tea Party either identify as Republicans ( 53 % ) or lean to the Republican Party ( 39 % ) . Just 1 % of all of those who express agreement with the Tea Party identify as Democrats , while 5 % lean to the Democratic Party and 2 % have no partisan leaning .
The election is the public 's top news story this week : Fully 60 % say they followed news about the presidential election very closely . That is the same as the percentage tracking election news during the week that Obama was elected president four years ago ( 60 % ) . Nearly half ( 46 % ) followed news about the impact of Hurricane Sandy very closely , down slightly from 53 % a week prior . Interest in news about the fiscal cliff nearly equals interest in news about the economy . Nearly four-in-ten ( 38 % ) followed news about the debate in Washington over the possible spending cuts and tax increases very closely ; 41 % paid very close attention to economic news . In July , just 23 % followed news about the possible tax and spending changes very closely .
Among adult whites , 89 percent finish high school and nearly 30 percent a college degree . Among Hispanics only 57 percent finish high school and about 10 percent earn a college degree . But , these averages are deceptive . More than half of Latino adults are first generation , i.e . foreign-born immigrants . Few arrive young enough to attend U.S. schools . But 73 percent of U.S.-born Latino adults finish high school , 40 percent obtain some college education , and 14 percent earn at least a four-year degree . Native versus immigrant experiences are critically different when it comes to high school completion , the greatest educational difficulty facing Hispanic children . Only about 7 percent of white children drop out . The statistics suggest that about 15 percent of native Latino children drop out compared with 44 percent of immigrant children . For some Latino immigrants this reflects their experience in U.S. schools , but many others , especially those who arrive as older adolescents , never `` drop in , '' that is they go straight to work while their American peers are still studying . The Department of Education finds that more than half of Latino immigrant dropouts never enroll in schools here . However , immigrant children arriving before the eighth grade do much better in U.S. schools . These youngsters have an easier time adjusting and go on to finish high school and reach college at rates similar to native Latino children .
Among registered Republican voters , Trump supporters stand out for their negative view of free trade : 67 % of Trump supporters say free trade agreements have been a bad thing for the U.S. , while just 27 % say they have been a good thing . Republican supporters of Ted Cruz ( 48 % good thing vs. 40 % bad thing ) and John Kasich ( 44 % good thing vs. 46 % bad thing ) hold more mixed views .
The only national institution asked about in the survey that has a positive rating from Turks is the military . About half ( 52 % ) of the public say that the military is having a good influence on the way things are going in Turkey , while 37 % say it is having a bad influence . Turks are divided on many of the other major institutions in their country . Nearly equal numbers say that the police , national government and religious leaders are either a good or bad influence . About four-in-ten ( 41 % ) say that the court system has a good effect on the nation , but 48 % rate its influence as bad .
While previous research on the labor market shows that the pandemic has similarly affected mothers and fathers overall from September 2019 to September 2020 , a new Pew Research Center analysis finds that the share of unpartnered mothers who are employed and at work has fallen more precipitously than among other parents . In September 2020 , six months since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak , 67.4 % of unpartnered mothers with children younger than 18 at home were working – employed and on the job – compared with 76.1 % in September 2019 . This 9 percentage point drop is the largest among all groups of parents , partnered or not . Unpartnered fathers experienced a less severe decrease ( 4 points ) , about the same as the drop seen by partnered mothers and fathers ( about 5 points each ) .
Russians and Americans are both similarly split on the changing nature of American power – but are more likely to say Russia 's international importance is rising . Opinions in both countries are divided over whether the U.S. is playing a more important , equally important or less important role in the world compared with 10 years ago . But there is more agreement that Russia 's importance has increased . Around seven-in-ten Russians ( 72 % ) say this , as do 52 % of Americans . People in both countries also agree that China plays a more important role in the world today than a decade ago ( 73 % and 72 % , respectively ) .
Solid majorities say news organizations have given too much coverage to the Weiner photo scandal ( 63 % ) and to Sarah Palin 's bus tour of historic sites ( 58 % ) . By contrast , just 11 % say news about U.S. plans and policies for Afghanistan have been over-covered ; 42 % say this story has gotten too little media attention .
Explicitly anti-social behavior while in public is considerably less common . Some 23 % of cellphone owners say that when they are in public spaces they use their phone to avoid interacting with others who are nearby at least on occasion . Of course , those around the cellphone user may still experience various uses of cellphones as anti-social , even if that was not the intention of the user .
Because of the federal government shutdown , there was no official word from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Friday on September 's unemployment rate or how many payroll jobs businesses added last month ( the more significant indicator , according to most economists ) . But we do have a fairly reliable substitute : the monthly report on private-sector jobs produced by Automatic Data Processing , or ADP . According to ADP , businesses added 166,000 jobs last month .
In contrast , Iraq divides America along partisan lines in a way that Vietnam never did . The latest Pew survey finds that 73 % of Democrats believe that military action in Iraq was the wrong decision , compared with just 14 % of Republicans – a gap roughly three times as great as the largest partisan gap in opinions about Vietnam . ( In June 1967 , 51 % of Republicans viewed Vietnam as a mistake , compared with 33 % of Democrats . )
Crime and corruption , common scourges of modern societies , top the list of problems cited by publics in emerging and developing nations . A median of 83 % of people across 34 emerging and developing economies say crime is a very big problem in their country , and 76 % say the same about corrupt political leaders . Many also worry about issues such as health care , poor quality schools , water and air pollution , and food safety . Generally , electricity shortages and traffic are seen as less pressing issues .
Democrats – especially liberals – are deeply skeptical that the White House will make serious efforts to block Russia from intervening in future elections . A large majority of liberal Democrats ( 70 % ) , along with about half ( 51 % ) of the party 's conservatives and moderates , say they are `` not at all confident '' the administration will make serious efforts .
The national news media focused heavily on the presidential race last week – devoting 50 % of its overall coverage to the campaign , according to PEJ . Public interest was split evenly between the campaign and the rising price of gasoline . Two-thirds of the public paid very close attention to news about gas prices last week – unchanged from the previous week and up moderately from early last month . Fully 37 % listed gas prices as the single news story they were following more closely than any other last week , roughly equal to the proportion ( 36 % ) naming the campaign as their most closely followed story .
Overall favorability ratings for business corporations are very similar to those of labor unions : 48 % hold a favorable view of business corporations , compared with 43 % who hold an unfavorable view .
These investigative journalists do not put much stock in their internet service providers to keep their data secure . Just 2 % have `` a lot of confidence '' their ISP can protect their data from being accessed by unauthorized parties , while 71 % have `` not much or no confidence at all . ''
As smartphones and other mobile devices have become more widespread , 28 % of American adults now report that they go online `` almost constantly , '' up from 21 % in 2015 , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Jan. 8 to Feb. 7 , 2019 . Overall , 81 % of Americans say they go online on a daily basis . That figure includes the 28 % who go online almost constantly , as well as 45 % who say they go online several times a day and 9 % who go online about once a day . Some 8 % go online several times a week or less often , while 10 % of adults say they do not use the internet at all .
These views are similar to attitudes about U.S. relations with Cuba in July 2015 , following the decision to renew diplomatic ties . At that time , 73 % approved of the re-establishment of U.S diplomatic relations with Cuba , and 72 % favored an end to the trade embargo .
Ukraine is an overwhelmingly Orthodox Christian nation , with nearly eight-in-ten adults ( 78 % ) identifying as Orthodox ( compared with 71 % in Russia ) , according to a 2015 Pew Research Center survey of much of the country ( some contested areas in eastern Ukraine were not surveyed ) . This is up from 39 % who said they were Orthodox Christian in 1991 – the year the officially atheist Soviet Union collapsed and Ukraine gained its independence . With roughly 35 million Orthodox Christians , Ukraine now has the third-largest Orthodox population in the world , after Russia and Ethiopia .
Republicans are much more optimistic about the country 's economic future . About half ( 48 % ) say they expect economic conditions will be better a year from now , compared with only 15 % of Democrats .
But votes cast on Election Day have grown steadily less significant over the past several election cycles as a share of total votes cast , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of two datasets . In 1996 , 89.5 % of voters reported voting in person on Election Day , according to the Census Bureau 's post-election surveys . As recently as 2006 , that share was 80.4 % . But then the in-person Election Day portion of the vote began to skid , falling to below 60 % each election cycle since 2014 . The trend also is evident in the biennial Election Administration and Voting Survey ( EAVS ) , conducted by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission , a federal agency charged with helping states meet federal election rules . The survey , which gathers voting , registration and election-administration data from state and local officials , found that the share of votes cast at physical polling places on Election Day fell from 75.1 % in 2006 to 55.4 % in 2018 .
An estimated 2.1 million Hispanics of Dominican origin lived in the United States in 2017 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey . Dominicans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Dominican origin ; this includes immigrants from Dominican Republic and those who trace their family ancestry to Dominican Republic . Dominicans are the fifth-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States , accounting for 4 % of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017 . Since 2000 , the Dominican-origin population has increased 159 % , growing from 797,000 to 2.1 million over the period . At the same time , the Dominican foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 106 % , from 543,800 in 2000 to 1.1 million in 2017 . By comparison , Mexicans , the nation 's largest Hispanic origin group , constituted 36.6 million , or 62 % , of the Hispanic population in 2017 .
Substantial majorities of internet users are able to correctly answer questions about some common technology platforms and everyday internet usage terms . Around three-quarters know that a megabyte is bigger than a kilobyte , roughly seven in ten are able to identify pictures corresponding to terms like `` captcha '' and `` advanced search , '' and 66 % know that a `` wiki '' is a tool that allows people to modify online content in collaboration with others . A substantial majority of online adults do not use Twitter , but knowledge of Twitter conventions is fairly widespread nonetheless : 82 % of online Americans are aware that hashtags are most commonly used on the social networking platform , and 60 % correctly answer that the service limits tweets to 140 characters . On the other hand , relatively few internet users are familiar with certain concepts that underpin the internet and other modern technological advances . Only one third ( 34 % ) know that Moore 's Law relates to how many transistors can be put on a microchip , and just 23 % are aware that `` the Internet '' and `` the World Wide Web '' do not , in fact , refer to the same thing . Many online Americans also struggle with key facts relating to early—and in some cases , more recent—technological history . Despite an Oscar-winning movie ( The Social Network ) about the story of Facebook 's founding , fewer than half of internet users ( 42 % ) are able to identify Harvard as the first university to be on the site ; and only 36 % correctly selected 2007 as the year the first iPhone was released . The Mosaic web browser is an especially poorly-remembered pioneer of the early Web , as just 9 % of online Americans are able to correctly identify Mosaic as the first widely popular graphical web browser .
Across 27 nations surveyed by Pew Research Center in 2018 , people were more dissatisfied than satisfied with the way democracy is working in their country . This held especially true in a dozen countries where negative views of democracy outpaced positive by more than 10 percentage points . The 12 countries most dissatisfied with their democracy included four – Mexico , Greece , Brazil and Spain – where eight-in-ten or more were dissatisfied with the state of democracy , and another five where six-in-ten or more expressed dissatisfaction : Tunisia , Italy , South Africa , Argentina and Nigeria . The United States was close behind , with 58 % expressing unhappiness with the way democracy is functioning . People 's views of their country 's economy were strongly linked to their views of democracy . In nine of the 12 countries most dissatisfied with democracy , at least two-thirds of those who said their country 's current economic situation is bad also were dissatisfied with democracy . ( In the remaining three – Greece , Tunisia and Brazil – so few people said the economy is good that the relationship between views of the economy and of democracy could not be analyzed . In these countries , 90 % or more of the public was unhappy with the economy . )
About a third of Trump 's November 2016 voters ( 35 % ) had cold or neutral feelings toward him earlier that year . By September 2016 , a 57 % majority of these voters had warmed to him , including 24 % who felt very warmly . And shortly after the election , three-quarters of these once cold or neutral voters ( 74 % ) felt warmly toward him , including 43 % who rated him very warmly . Among the 65 % majority of Trump voters who felt warmly toward him in April 2016 , there was much less change in opinions about him . Of this group , 90 % or more maintained warm feelings toward him in September and November 2016 .
A third ( 34 % ) of American adults ages 18 and older own a tablet computer like an iPad , Samsung Galaxy Tab , Google Nexus , or Kindle Fire—almost twice as many as the 18 % who owned a tablet a year ago . The following chart shows the increase in general tablet ownership over time , beginning with May 2010 when just 3 % of adults said they owned a tablet computer .
Sen. Hillary Clinton would not have won primaries in the nation 's two largest states—California and Texas—if Latinos had not turned out in such large numbers and if they had not voted so heavily in her favor , according to an analysis of exit polling data . She also would not have carried a third state—New Mexico—without strong Latino support . In all three states , Latinos accounted for at least 30 % of the total votes cast in the Democratic primary , and Clinton outpolled Sen. Barack Obama among Latinos by a ratio of about two-to-one . In Tuesday 's primary in Texas , Clinton 's winning margin of votes among Latinos was nearly three times as great as her overall statewide lead in votes . Calculations based on exit poll data show that Obama carried Texas by 55 % to 44 % among all non-Latino voters . However , Latinos accounted for 32 % of votes cast in the Texas primary , up from 24 % in 2004 . They favored Clinton over Obama by 66 % to 32 % . In the Feb. 5 primary in California , Clinton 's winning margin of votes among Latinos was slightly larger than her statewide tally over Obama . Based on calculations made using exit poll data , the vote for Clinton and Obama among all non-Latino voters was a statistical dead heat of 46 % to 46 % . However , Hispanics made up 30 % of the Democratic primary electorate in California , up from 16 % in the 2004 Democratic primary . They favored Clinton over Obama by 67 % to 32 % . In a tight race , Clinton won New Mexico by only one percentage point . Among Hispanics , however , her winning margin of votes was nine times as great as her overall statewide vote lead . Non-Hispanics voted for Obama 56 % to 41 % . In contrast , Hispanics favored Clinton 62 % to 36 % , and they were 35 % of all voters .
People 's views about scientists connected with GM foods : Americans with deep concern about the issue of GM foods hold mixed views about scientists connected with GM foods . Those deeply concerned about this issue say that scientists understand the health effects of GM foods very well ( 32 % ) . And , 35 % of this group says they trust scientists a lot to provide full and accurate information about the health effects of eating GM foods . But in these areas their views look similar to Americans with less concern about the issue of GM foods .
Conversely , television broadcasting employees now account for a larger portion of all newsroom employees , rising from 25 % in 2008 to 34 % in 2019 . The proportion for digital-native has tripled over the period evaluated , from 6 % of all newsroom employees in 2008 to 18 % in 2019 .
After peaking at 38 % in mid-2008 during Obama 's presidential election campaign , the number of Americans describing the Democratic Party as friendly toward religion returned in mid-2009 to levels similar to those seen in 2005 through 2007 . About one-in-five say Democrats are unfriendly toward religion ( 22 % ) , up from 15 % who felt that way last year but about the same as in surveys conducted in 2005 and 2006 .
More than one-in-ten ( 13 % ) say they followed Woods ' return to play very closely , while 9 % say this was the story they followed most closely . News about the golfer made up 5 % of the newshole as measured by PEJ . About a quarter of the public ( 24 % ) says they very closely followed news about a series of developments in Obama 's push to place greater controls on the world 's nuclear weapons ; 7 % say this was the story they followed most closely . News stories about U.S. nuclear policy account for 6 % of the newshole . About two-in-ten ( 21 % ) say they followed news about Afghanistan very closely , while 3 % say this was the story they followed most closely . Reporting about Afghanistan made up 2 % of coverage .
Orthodox Christians have decreased as a share of the overall Christian population even as their numbers have more than doubled since 1910 , when there were 125 million of them . This decrease in share is due to the fact that the worldwide populations of Catholics , Protestants and other Christians have collectively almost quadrupled over the last century ( from 490 million in 1910 to 1.9 billion in 2010 ) . Roughly one-in-eight Christians ( 12 % ) are now Orthodox , down from one-in-five ( 20 % ) in 1910 .
Whether they take place on the internet or off , traditional political activities remain the domain of those with high levels of income and education . Contrary to the hopes of some advocates , the internet is not changing the socio-economic character of civic engagement in America . Just as in offline civic life , the well-to-do and well-educated are more likely than those less well off to participate in online political activities such as emailing a government official , signing an online petition or making a political contribution . In part , these disparities result from differences in internet access—those who are lower on the socio-economic ladder are less likely to go online or to have broadband access at home , making it impossible for them to engage in online political activity . Yet even within the online population there is a strong positive relationship between socio-economic status and most of the measures of internet-based political engagement we reviewed .
Views of Congress continue to hover near record lows : Just 25 % of Americans view Congress favorably , while 69 % say they have an unfavorable opinion .
While meeting partners through personal networks is still the most common kind of introduction , about one-in-ten partnered adults ( 12 % ) say they met their partner online . About a third ( 32 % ) of adults who are married , living with a partner or are in a committed relationship say friends and family helped them find their match . Smaller shares say they met through work ( 18 % ) , through school ( 17 % ) , online ( 12 % ) , at a bar or restaurant ( 8 % ) , at a place of worship ( 5 % ) or somewhere else ( 8 % ) . Meeting online is more common among younger adults and those who live in urban and suburban areas , as well as those who are lesbian , gay or bisexual ( LGB ) . About one-in-five partnered adults ages 18 to 29 ( 21 % ) say they met their partner online , compared with 15 % or fewer among their older counterparts . And while 28 % of partnered LGB adults say they met their partner online , 11 % of those who are straight say the same .
In looking at how successful Internet users have been in finding the information they need online , the following chart shows how Internet users fare when they go online to satisfy information needs . Most of the time searchers in these categories find what they want—more than 70 % in all categories . For news , 41 % of online news hounds say they always find what they want on the Net .
Few Americans trust Instagram as a place to get political and election news . Just 6 % of U.S. adults say they trust Instagram as a place to get political and election news , with a much larger share ( 42 % ) saying they distrust it for such information , according to a fall 2019 survey . Some 37 % of U.S. adults say they neither trust nor distrust the site for this type of news . Americans have more distrust than trust in all the social media platforms asked about in the survey . For example , 17 % of Americans say they trust YouTube as a place for political and election news , while 36 % say they distrust the site . And while 15 % of U.S. adults say they trust Facebook for this type of information , a much larger share ( 59 % ) say they distrust this platform as a place to get political and election news .
More than half of men ( 55 % ) say they are in favor of the death penalty and 38 % are opposed . Women 's views are more divided : 43 % favor the death penalty , 45 % oppose it .
Indians ' approval of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and their satisfaction with both their country 's direction and the state of its economy have grown in recent years . Three years into Modi 's five-year tenure , the honeymoon period for his administration may be over but the public 's love affair with current conditions in India is even more intense . Nearly nine-in-ten Indians hold a favorable opinion of Modi , comparable to their view of him in 2015 , after a year in office . Roughly seven-in-ten say they have a very favorable view of the prime minister , again similar to public views in 2015 .
Yet these broader concerns often coexist with perceived benefits to users . For instance , despite widespread concerns that mobile phones might expose people to false or inaccurate information , a sizable majority of mobile phone users ( 79 % ) say their own phone has helped their ability to get news and information about important issues . Similarly , a median of 58 % of mobile phone users say their devices have helped their ability to communicate face-to-face – even as a median of 48 % of adults in these countries say people should be very worried about mobile phones ' effects on face-to-face communication .
When asked in an open-ended format to name the economic or financial problem they have been hearing the most about in the news lately , fully 72 % of Americans point to gas and oil prices . No other issue comes close . The housing and mortgage crisis is a distant second with 11 % of the public naming this as the economic issue they have been hearing the most about .
About two-in-ten Americans ( 21 % ) say they have ever spoken with or been interviewed by a local journalist , according to a recent Pew Research Center survey . Among those who have , the likelihood varies by personal characteristics .
India and Pakistan have been divided by decades of political animosities , a nuclear arms race and several wars . Indians and Pakistanis see each other 's country as the biggest threat to their national security , according to Pew Research 's 2012 polls in the respective countries . When asked to choose the most serious threat to their country , 41 % of Indians point to Pakistan . Among Pakistanis , 59 % pick India .
Frustration with the feeling that some corporations and wealthy people do not pay their fair share of taxes is shared widely across demographic and partisan groups . Fully 75 % of Democrats are bothered a lot by the feeling that corporations do not pay their fair share of taxes , and 72 % say the same about wealthy people not paying their fair share . Fewer Republicans are bothered a lot by some corporations ( 52 % ) and wealthy people ( 45 % ) not paying their fair share . Still , these rank among the Republicans ' top concerns among five items tested .
Although young adults continue to have relatively high rates of Twitter usage , the number of 30 - 49 year olds who use the service has doubled since late 2010—from 7 % of such users in November to 14 % in May 2011 . This growth trend is especially pronounced among 25 - 34 year olds—Twitter use for this cohort roughly doubled between November 2010 and May 2011 , from 9 % to 19 % —although growth in Twitter use among internet users ages 35 - 44 was notable as well ( from 8 % in late 2010 to 14 % in spring 2011 ) . By contrast , Twitter adoption over the same time period was stable among the youngest adults ( those ages 18 - 24 ) who were the most likely to use the service in our first survey .
Along with examining the general ways in which teens interact and communicate with their friends , this report documents how and where teens interact with the friends who are closest to them . These `` close friend '' relationships loom large in the day-to-day social activities of teens ' lives , as 59 % of teens are in touch with their closest friend on a daily basis ( with 41 % indicating that they get in touch `` many times a day '' ) .
Higher-income Americans are also more likely to have multiple devices that enable them to go online . Roughly two-thirds of adults living in high-earning households ( 64 % ) have home broadband services , a smartphone , a desktop or laptop computer and a tablet , compared with 18 % of those living in lower-income households .
Even though many people in the nations surveyed say they want less immigration , there is considerable support for accepting both refugees who flee violence ( a median of 77 % ) and immigrants who are highly skilled ( 64 % ) . At the same time , large shares back deporting immigrants currently in the country illegally ( a median of 69 % ) . When asked if highly skilled people from other nations should be encouraged to move to their country , roughly half or more in eight of 10 European countries polled support this approach . Agreement with this policy ranges from 35 % in Italy to 88 % in Sweden .
Teens now spend about seven and a half hours a day engaged in leisure activities during the summer . While this still accounts for the bulk of their waking hours , it represents a 24-minute decline from a decade ago . This decline has been largely driven by a 22-minute drop in time spent socializing or going to entertainment or sporting events . On the flip side , teens now spend 18 more minutes a day in active pursuits such as playing sports or exercising compared with teens a decade ago . What has not changed substantially is the amount of time they spend on screens in the summer : Teens now devote more than three and a half hours a day to activities such as gaming , watching TV , surfing the web and watching videos – a figure that has ticked down only slightly in the past decade .
In terms of press coverage , Barack Obama , who was on vacation last week , still generated more campaign news coverage than John McCain ( 63 % vs. 50 % , according to the Campaign Coverage Index from Pew 's Project for Excellence in Journalism ) . That said , last week was among the closest weeks between Obama and McCain in terms of campaign coverage since the general election began in earnest during early June . In addition to narrowing the gap in coverage , John McCain also increased his public visibility last week relative to Barack Obama . While Obama was still by far the most visible candidate , John McCain narrowed that advantage somewhat : 62 % of Americans now say that Obama is the candidate they have been hearing most about in the news , while 19 % cite John McCain .
Overall , two-thirds of Americans either do not know how the Supreme Court ruled on the Voting Rights Act ( 43 % ) or say incorrectly that it kept the law in effect ( 23 % ) . Only about a third ( 34 % ) know that the court overturned parts of the law .
For most of the past 60 years , the overall experience level of the House has varied within a narrow range : The average length of service was typically between five and six terms , while the median was four or five terms . Over the past few election cycles , though , the share of less-experienced representatives ( those in their first through third terms ) has risen significantly . In 2009 , 147 representatives ( 33.8 % of the entire body ) had six years or less of House experience ; by 2013 that had risen to 196 , or 45 % . The shift has been even more pronounced in the Senate : 54 senators are in their first term , the most since the 97th Congress in 1981 . The average length of service has fallen from 14 years in 2009 to less than 10 years in the current Congress ; the median length of service in the Senate , six years , is the lowest it 's been since 1981 .
The analysis of national standardized testing scores shows that about 51 % of 8th grade ELL students are behind whites in reading and math , meaning that the scores for one out of every two will have to improve for the group to achieve parity . In the 4th grade , 35 % of ELL students are behind in math and 47 % are behind in reading when compared with their white counterparts . The report also compares scores for ELL students to those of black and Hispanics students and finds smaller but still substantial gaps .
The U.S. Hispanic population reached a record 60.6 million in 2019 , up 930,000 over the previous year and up from 50.7 million in 2010 , according to newly released U.S. Census Bureau population estimates . Over the past decade , however , population growth among Hispanics has slowed as the annual number of births to Hispanic women has declined and immigration has decreased , particularly from Mexico . Population growth among U.S. Hispanics has slowed since the start of the decade . From 2015 to 2019 , the nation 's Hispanic population grew by an average of 1.9 % per year – similar to the 2.1 % annual growth between 2010 and 2015 , but down from annual growth of more than 3 % in earlier years .
Among the 15 Western European countries we surveyed , six have mandatory taxes for members of the largest churches to help finance their activities – Austria , Denmark , Finland , Germany , Sweden and Switzerland . While most registered Christians ( and in some countries , members of other religious groups ) in these countries are required to pay the tax , they have the option of not paying by deregistering from their church . The same basic pattern holds true for levels of religious observance . A minority of adults in church tax countries say they attend worship services monthly or more , with the highest shares in Austria ( 30 % ) , Switzerland ( 29 % ) and Germany ( 24 % ) . That 's roughly in line with the share of people who say this in countries without a church tax , with Ireland ( 37 % ) , France ( 22 % ) and the UK ( 20 % ) topping that list .
Strikingly , there is currently no major partisan difference in public views of the economy . But the more positive public assessment of the economy these days has been driven by changing Republican attitudes . Roughly six-in-ten Republicans ( 61 % ) and Democrats ( 60 % ) say conditions are very or somewhat good , with sentiment among GOP supporters roughly doubling in the past year . More than half ( 54 % ) of independents agree . Just a year ago there was a 26-percentage-point partisan difference on economic conditions , with Democrats being far more bullish on the economy than Republicans . This was the case throughout the Obama administration .
Women , blacks , Asians and Hispanics have built up substantial positions as business owners in several sectors of the U.S. economy . But based on revenue , those businesses are on average considerably smaller than white- or male-owned firms , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of recently released data from the U.S. Census Bureau . Overall , men owned more than half of the nation 's 27.6 million firms in 2012 , according to preliminary results from the Survey of Business Owners , and women owned more than 9.9 million businesses , about 36 % of the total . The remaining 10 % of firms were either jointly owned by men and women or could not be categorized by gender because they were publicly traded companies or have large , diverse ownership groups .
When Pew next surveyed Indonesia in 2005 , however , America 's favorable rating had more than doubled to 38 % , an increase due in large part to the aid provided by the U.S. after the December 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,000 in Indonesia . Indeed , 79 % of Indonesians said that the aid led them to have a more positive view of the U.S. A year later , the 2006 survey shows a slight decline in evaluations of the U.S. , although at 30 % , America 's favorable rating is still significantly higher than it was in 2003 .
Bush 's overall job approval rating has slipped to 54 % , down four points since last month and seven points since December . The president 's handling of the threat of terrorism remains a strong point ­ fully two-thirds approve of his performance in that area . And a solid majority ( 56 % ) approves of his handling of the Iraq crisis , unchanged since October . But positive assessments of his economic policy have slipped from 49 % in October to 43 % in the current survey .
The tense negotiations in Washington over legislation to cut the federal deficit and raise the nation 's debt limit topped the public 's news interest and the media 's coverage for the third consecutive week . Four-in-ten ( 40 % ) say they followed news about the debt debate more closely than any other news last week , while the fight 's various story lines accounted for 47 % of the week 's coverage .
This increasingly positive attitude toward national conditions can also be seen in the public 's improving economic assessments , as the country recovers from the global recession that began in 2008 . Thirty-seven percent say the current economic situation is good , up 20 percentage points from last spring . Though 51 % still believe the economy is in poor shape , this number has dropped 30 percentage points in only a year . Again , men ( 45 % ) are more likely than women ( 28 % ) to say that the economy is doing well .
The character of the person who occupies the Oval Office matters to the vast majority of Americans . Across party lines and religious groups , roughly nine-in-ten or more say it is either somewhat or very important to have a president who lives a moral , ethical life . But Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party are more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say it is `` very '' important ( 71 % vs. 53 % ) , according to a recent Pew Research Center survey . Fewer Americans ( 52 % ) say it 's either somewhat ( 32 % ) or very ( 20 % ) important for a president to have strong religious beliefs , even if those beliefs are different from their own . But Republicans place more of a premium on having a president who is religious : About two-thirds of Republicans ( 65 % ) say this trait is at least somewhat important , compared with four-in-ten Democrats who say this ( 41 % ) . Generally speaking , when it comes to traits that are important for a president to have , Americans care less about having a president who shares their religious beliefs than they do about having one who stands up for their religious beliefs . Four-in-ten U.S. adults ( 39 % ) say it 's at least somewhat important for a president to share their religious beliefs – though Republicans ( 53 % ) are about twice as likely as Democrats ( 27 % ) to say that this matters .
Republican men ( 40 % ) are more likely to oppose granting legal status than are Republican women ( 32 % ) . And while younger Republicans ( those ages 18 to 49 ) broadly support granting legal status to those brought to the U.S. illegally as children ( 59 % favor , 34 % oppose ) , older Republicans are more divided ( 49 % favor , 38 % oppose ) .
Majorities or pluralities in 31 of the 34 emerging and developing nations surveyed say young people should stay at home to be successful , including more than eight-in-ten in Thailand , Indonesia , Vietnam , Malaysia and Tanzania . In just seven countries do at least four-in-ten say the next generation has more opportunities abroad . This includes publics that have recently witnessed massive political and economic upheaval , such as the Egyptians , worsening ethnic conflict , such as the Lebanese , and severe gang violence , such as the Salvadorans . Poles are also more inclined than most publics to say that young people should move abroad to have a good life . This may reflect the open borders between Poland and other EU countries as well as dissatisfaction with economic conditions at home .
Fathers who are employed and at work cut back on the hours they spent on the job by a little more than mothers did . From September 2019 to September 2020 , the average weekly hours worked by fathers fell from 43.3 to 40.5 – nearly three hours per week . At the same time , mothers pared their average weekly hours from 36.8 to 35.0 , close to two hours per week . The change in work hours among mothers and fathers did not vary notably by the ages of the youngest children at home .
The survey found interesting differences between the global middle class and others in all of the 13 countries in this study , but these gaps were especially consistent in a few places . Notable differences were particularly common in Chile , Russia , Bulgaria , and South Africa . Looking at the 16 measures analyzed , on 14 of those middle class Chileans differed from lower income Chileans by at least five percentage points . Differences were only slightly less common in Russia ( 13 ) , Bulgaria ( 12 ) , and South Africa ( 12 ) .
A median of 57 % say immigration increases the risk of terrorism in their countries , while 38 % say it has no impact . Still , in France , Spain and the UK , half or more believe immigration does not increase the odds of terrorism .
About three-quarters of conservative Republicans ( 77 % ) continue to say the Supreme Court should base its rulings on the Constitution 's original meaning rather than its meaning in current times ( 21 % ) . But moderate and liberal Republicans are more divided : 50 % favor an interpretation based on the Constitution 's original meaning , compared with 46 % who say the court should base its rulings on a current interpretation . Ideological differences are less pronounced among Democrats . Liberal Democrats ( 88 % ) overwhelmingly say the Supreme Court should base its rulings on the Constitution 's meaning in current times , as do a majority ( 70 % ) of conservative and moderate Democrats . Views on constitutional interpretation also vary by age , even within both partisan coalitions . Americans 50 and older are divided , with 47 % saying the Supreme Court should base its rulings on what the Constitution currently means and 49 % saying they favor an interpretation based on the document 's original meaning . But among Americans younger than 50 , 64 % say the high court should base rulings on the Constitution 's current meaning , compared with 33 % who say decisions should be based on the original meaning .
President George W. Bush is losing ground with the public in his efforts to build support for private retirement accounts in Social Security . Despite Bush 's intensive campaign to promote the idea , the percentage of Americans who say they favor private accounts has tumbled to 46 % in Pew 's latest nationwide survey , down from 54 % in December and 58 % in September . Support has declined as the public has become increasingly aware of the president 's plan . More than four-in-ten ( 43 % ) say they have heard a lot about the proposal , nearly double the number who said that in December ( 23 % ) .
Exposure to false or incorrect information is a key concern for people in 11 emerging economies , according to a recent Pew Research Center survey . Many social media users report being regularly exposed to misinformation when using the platforms . In most countries surveyed , more than a quarter of social media and messaging app users say they frequently encounter this sort of content , and majorities in 10 of the 11 countries say they see it at least occasionally .
A median of 78 % in the eight countries surveyed say a lack of jobs is a very big problem in their country . And a median of 71 % cite the public debt . Except in Germany , overwhelming majorities in many countries say unemployment , the public debt , rising prices and the gap between the rich and the poor are very important problems . Unemployment is the number one worry in seven of the eight countries . Inequality is the principle concern in Germany .
In 27 of the 46 nations plus the Palestinian Territories covered by the survey , the balance of opinion regarding China is decidedly favorable ; in just five countries are views of China significantly more negative than positive . By comparison , the balance of opinion about the United States is favorable in 25 of the 47 countries ; but views of America are decidedly negative in many more countries – half or more of the publics in 18 countries express disapproving views of the United States . China 's fans are most prevalent in the neighboring Asian countries of Malaysia ( 83 % favorable ) , Pakistan ( 79 % ) , Bangladesh ( 74 % ) , Indonesia ( 65 % ) , as well as in most African countries ( 92 % favorable in both Ivory Coast and Mali and between 67 % and 81 % in Kenya , Senegal , Ghana , Nigeria , Tanzania and Ethiopia ) . Negative views of China are especially strong in Japan , where 67 % say they have a generally unfavorable view of China while an even larger majority ( 80 % ) disapproves of China 's expanding military strength . Several European countries also cast a worried eye on the Middle Kingdom with majorities in Italy ( 61 % ) , the Czech Republic ( 58 % ) , Germany ( 54 % ) , France ( 51 % ) as well as Turkey ( 53 % ) saying they hold an unfavorable view of China .
Roughly seven-in-ten U.S. adults ( 72 % ) say they have read a book in the past 12 months in any format , a figure that has remained largely unchanged since 2012 , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Jan. 8-Feb. 7 , 2019 . Print books remain the most popular format for reading , with 65 % of adults saying they had read a print book in the year before the survey .
Women are personally more optimistic about the year ahead than are men . More than half of women ( 55 % ) say that 2008 will be a better year than 2007 , while just 28 % expect the coming year to be worse . Fewer than half of men ( 46 % ) are personally upbeat about 2008 , while 40 % expect it to be a worse year than 2007 . Young people consistently express more personal optimism than do older Americans , and this is reflected in their upbeat outlook for 2008 . Two-thirds ( 66 % ) of those younger than 30 say this year will be better than last , compared with 50 % of those ages 30 to 49 and slightly more than 40 % for 50 and older .
Nevertheless , the Japanese are divided on how best to deal with their superpower neighbor . In thinking about relations with China , 47 % say having a strong economic relationship is the most important thing to do , while 45 % believe the best way forward is to be tough on territorial disputes between Japan and China .
Russians praise Putin despite their country 's economic troubles . Views of the economy in Russia have soured over the past year , as the fall of oil prices and ongoing economic sanctions imposed by the West have taken their toll . Still , Russians overwhelmingly support President Vladimir Putin 's handling of relations with foreign powers , such as the U.S. and the EU , as well as his handling of the Russian economy . And 62 % even praise Putin for his performance on corruption . Nearly nine-in-ten ( 88 % ) Russians have confidence in Putin to handle international affairs , including 66 % who have a lot of confidence . Overall confidence in Putin is up 19 percentage points since before the start of the Ukraine conflict .
Recent migrants added to already substantial foreign-born populations living in Sweden , Norway and Austria – all nations in which the foreign born make up 15 % or more of the population in 2016 . Sweden had the greatest increase , rising from about 16.8 % in 2015 to 18.3 % in 2016 , a 1.5-percentage-point increase . The foreign-born shares in Norway ( 15.3 % in 2016 ) and Austria ( 18.5 % in 2016 ) increased by about 1 point over the same period . Countries with smaller immigrant populations like Hungary and Finland also saw their foreign-born shares increase significantly due to the 2015 - 2016 migration surge . Hungary 's foreign-born share rose from 4.6 % in 2015 to 5.8 % in 2016 , a 1.3-point increase . In Finland , the share of foreign born rose an estimated 0.8 points , from 5.7 % to 6.5 % . Several European countries , however , saw little change in their percent foreign born between 2015 and 2016 . The United Kingdom and France – countries with significant immigrant populations – received far fewer asylum applicants relative to their population size in 2015 - 16 than other countries , and each saw a relatively modest 0.2-percentage-point increase in their foreign-born shares ( to 13.4 % in the UK and 12.3 % in France for 2016 ) .
Public evaluations of the congressional leadership of both parties remain negative . Today , just a third ( 33 % ) say they approve of the job Democratic leaders are doing , while even fewer ( 22 % ) say they approve of GOP Congressional leadership .
Overall , these views are little changed over the past few years , but the partisan divide in opinion has continued to grow . Democrats are now significantly more likely than Republicans to say Russia is an adversary ( 34 % to 20 % , respectively ) , while Republicans are more than twice as likely as Democrats to say Russia is `` not much of a problem '' ( 38 % to 14 % ) .
This decline in apprehensions coincides with recently released estimates by Mexico 's top statistical agency , which show that the rate at which Mexicans migrated to the U.S. and other countries – including both legal and unauthorized immigrants – has held steady for the past five years , after a dramatic drop during the Great Recession . In addition to the latest trends in apprehensions , new data from the Mexican government 's main statistical agency ( Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía , or INEGI ) show that the level of emigration of Mexicans from their country to the U.S. and other countries remains well below levels prior to the Great Recession that began in 2007 . In 2015 , the emigration rate to other countries was 39 per 10,000 Mexican residents during the second quarter of the year , little changed since 2011 and down substantially from 144 per 10,000 during the same quarter in 2006 .
Two-thirds of Republicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party say that houses of worship should be required to follow the same rules about social distancing and large gatherings as other organizations and businesses in their local area , compared with a third who say they should be allowed more flexibility . An even bigger majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners – 93 % – believe houses of worship should be required to follow local rules about social distancing and large gatherings without exemptions from coronavirus-related regulations .
We looked at two measures of consumer confidence : the University of Michigan 's Index of Consumer Expectations ( part of its broader monthly surveys of consumer sentiment ) and the European Consumer Confidence Indicator , produced by Eurostat , the EU 's statistical research office . While the two metrics are broadly similar , they 're calculated differently and reported on different scales . The UMich index is derived from three questions on personal financial expectations a year from now and expectations for the U.S. economy one and five years out , relative to a 1966 base year . The EU metric is the average of the answers to four questions covering expectations for household finances , general economic conditions , unemployment and personal savings over the next 12 months . Despite some ups and downs , the U.S. expectations index generally has been trending modestly upward since the beginning of 2012 ; October 's preliminary reading of 78.4 , in fact , was the second-highest since the official end of the Great Recession . ( Not that Americans are ready to throw the economy a parade : In August , a Pew Research Center survey found that 54 % of the public expected national economic conditions to be about the same a year from now , while 22 % expected conditions to be better and the same percentage expected them to be worse . )
A majority of U.S. adults ( 64 % ) say social media have a mostly negative effect on the way things are going in the country today , with Republicans being more likely than Democrats to express that view , according to a July 2020 survey . The Americans who see a negative effect from social media point to factors including misinformation and the hate and harassment they see on these platforms .
Across the 38 nations in the survey , a median of just 9 % view the countries of the EU as the world 's leading economic power . By comparison , 42 % name the U.S. and 32 % name China , while an additional 7 % name Japan .
More veterans say the military did a good job preparing them for life in the service than it did in readying them for the transition to civilian life . Veterans across eras offer similarly positive evaluations of the job the military did preparing them for military life , but less so when it comes to the return to civilian life . Roughly nine-in-ten veterans ( 91 % ) say the training they received when they first entered the military prepared them very or somewhat well for military life . By contrast , about half ( 52 % ) say the military prepared them very or somewhat well for the transition to civilian life .
When asked whether the U.S. should prioritize economic relations with China or promote human rights in China , nearly three-quarters of Americans choose human rights , even if it harms economic relations with China . Democrats are more likely than Republicans to emphasize human rights over economic gain , though at least seven-in-ten of both groups hold this opinion . Younger and older Americans alike prefer more emphasis on human rights than economic relations when it comes to China . Less than a quarter of all age groups say the U.S. should prioritize economic relations with China , even if it means not addressing human rights issues .
A decade after the housing bust upended the lives of millions of Americans , more U.S. households are headed by renters than at any point since at least 1965 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau housing data . Meanwhile , the number of households renting their home increased significantly during that span , as did the share , which rose from 31.2 % of households in 2006 to 36.6 % in 2016 . The current renting level exceeds the recent high of 36.2 % set in 1986 and 1988 and approaches the rate of 37.0 % in 1965 .
Hillary Clinton won 66 % of Latino voters on Election Day , according to updated National Election Pool exit poll data , a level of Democratic support similar to 2008 , when 67 % of Hispanics backed Barack Obama . However , Clinton 's share of the Latino vote was lower than in 2012 , when 71 % of Latinos voted to re-elect Obama . While Clinton underperformed among Latinos compared with 2012 , Republican Donald Trump won 28 % of the Latino vote , a similar share to 2012 , when Mitt Romney won 27 % , and to 2008 , when John McCain won 31 % , according to exit polls . ( It is important to note that the national exit poll is a survey with an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for the national result . )
Between 2012 and 2015 , the average approximate design effect of the experimental weight using just the cellphone sample was 1.22 , which compares with an average of 1.32 using the actual survey weight based on both the landline and cellphone samples .
When it comes to progress for Hispanics as a group in the U.S. , Hispanics are divided . Half ( 49 % ) say the situation of U.S. Hispanics today is about the same as it was a year ago , while 32 % say it has worsened and 16 % say their group 's situation has improved .
Vladimir Putin 's third term as Russia 's president had already been marked by clear signs of his intention to reassert his country as a world power before his move to annex Crimea . But whatever impact the latest events have on international opinion about Putin , views about him in the U.S. and allied countries had already turned negative compared with when he was first elected to office in 2000 . A Gallup poll conducted Feb. 6 - 9 found that 63 % of Americans had an unfavorable view of Putin , the highest ever in its polling . That followed a year of U.S.-Russian tensions that included sharp differences over Syria , Russia 's decision to grant asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden and Putin 's op-ed piece in the New York Times taking issue with President Obama 's evocation of American exceptionalism . Asked how much confidence they had in Putin to do the right thing in world affairs , 54 % of Americans answered `` not too much '' or `` none at all '' in a 2012 survey , an increase of seven points compared with 2003 . In 2012 , just 28 % said they had `` a lot '' or `` some '' confidence in the Russian leader . But the public opinion changes were even more marked among the U.S. 's allies in Europe . In Britain , those saying they had little or no confidence in Putin to do the right thing jumped to 70 % in 2012 from 36 % in 2003 ; in France , it increased to 88 % from 52 % ; and , in Germany , to 77 % from 24 % .
As the two largest Spanish-language television networks in the U.S. , Univision and Telemundo are key providers of news for Spanish speakers . Univision 's average audience – measured as the average number of TVs tuned to a program throughout a period of time – declined for all three national time slots studied : a 12 % decline for the evening news time slot ( 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. ) , to an average audience of about 1 million ; a 14 % decline in late night news ( 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. ) ; and an 11 % decline for the morning news time slot ( 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. ) . Telemundo 's audience , on the other hand , increased by 7 % in the evening news time slot , to an audience of about 700 , ooo , and remained roughly steady at just under 400,000 for late night news .
Have you made your New Year 's resolution yet ? If so , you join the 44 % of Americans who say they will do so for 2014 , according to a Marist poll conducted in December 2013 among 1,173 adults . This share is up slightly from the 40 % who planned to make a resolution a year ago .
Close to four-in-ten ( 37 % ) Americans say they followed news about the economy very closely last week , a level of interest little changed since the start of December ; 14 % say they followed news about the economy most closely . Partisan differences on economic news are slight . Other stories garnered relatively low interest , including the visit to the U.S. by Chinese President Hu Jintao , news about political instability and earthquake recovery in Haiti and news about instability in Tunisia following the government 's collapse there . Just more than one-in-ten ( 13 % ) say they followed news about the Chinese leader 's visit very closely , while 3 % say this was the news they followed most closely . There are no significant differences in interest among partisans . Meanwhile , 16 % say they followed reports out of Haiti very closely and 7 % say they followed news about instability in Tunisia that closely . News out of Haiti accounted for 3 % of coverage , while news about Tunisia accounted for 2 % .
Nearly two-in-ten ( 18 % ) say they followed news about President Obama 's trip to Asia very closely ; 7 % say this was the news they followed most closely . In early April 2009 , shortly after Obama took office , 25 % said they very closely followed news about his first European trip and meetings with world leaders ; 22 % said the trip was the news they followed most closely that week . Just 13 % say they very closely followed news last week about the publication of George W. Bush 's book about his life ; 5 % say this was the news they followed most closely . News about the new book , `` Decision Points , '' made up 4 % of coverage measured by PEJ . About a quarter of Republicans ( 24 % ) say they followed news about the book very closely , compared with 9 % of Democrats and 10 % of independents . Another 15 % say they followed news about proposals to reduce the federal deficit unveiled by the leaders of a presidential panel ; 2 % say this was the news they followed most closely . News about the proposals accounted for 7 % of coverage . There were no significant differences among partisans in the numbers tracking this news very closely .
About six-in-ten Americans ( 61 % ) expect that Republicans and Democrats in Washington will bicker and oppose one another more than usual , while just 29 % say they expect the parties to work together more . Majorities have expected the parties to bicker and oppose rather than work together in recent years , though public predictions for partisan cooperation were substantially higher on the eve of Barack Obama 's inauguration eight years ago . In January 2009 , 50 % expected the two parties to work together more , while fewer ( 39 % ) expected greater hostility .
Urban residents are more likely than suburban and rural residents to see certain local news topics as important for daily life . For example , roughly half of adults in urban areas ( 49 % ) say crime is an important topic to follow for daily life – higher than those who live in suburban or rural areas ( 43 % each ) . Urban residents are also more likely to say news about jobs and unemployment is important to follow for daily life ( 21 % ) than those in suburban ( 13 % ) or rural ( 14 % ) areas . The same pattern of difference exists for government and politics and prices .
In the wake of reports that the National Security Agency ( NSA ) has been listening to phone calls of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other heads of state , a 56 % majority of Americans say it is unacceptable for the U.S. to monitor the phones of allied leaders , while 36 % say the practice is acceptable .
But despite QAnon 's spread , about three-quarters of U.S. adults ( 76 % ) say they have heard or read nothing at all about it , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in February and March . Around a quarter ( 23 % ) say they have heard or read a lot or a little , with 3 % saying they 've heard or read a lot . The data was gathered as part of the Center 's Election News Pathways project . About three-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents ( 28 % ) say they 've heard or read a little or a lot about QAnon , compared with 18 % of Republicans and those who lean toward the GOP . Overall , 3 % of those in or leaning toward both parties say they have heard or read a lot about the conspiracy theories . Although QAnon has gained a modest foothold among some far-right factions , liberal Democrats are the most likely of any ideological group to say they have heard or read something about it : 39 % have heard or read at least a little , and 5 % say they 've heard or read a lot . In contrast , 20 % of conservative and moderate Democrats have heard or read at least a little ; 2 % have heard or read a lot . Among Republicans , 20 % of conservatives say they have heard or read at least a little about QAnon , compared with 15 % of liberal and moderate Republicans . Identical shares ( 3 % ) of conservative Republicans and moderate and liberal Republicans have heard or read a lot about the conspiracy theories .
Automated accounts post a substantial share of links to a wide range of online media outlets on Twitter . As noted above , the Center 's analysis estimates that 66 % of tweeted links to popular news and current events websites are posted by bots . The analysis also finds that a relatively small number of automated accounts are responsible for a substantial share of the links to popular media outlets on Twitter . The 500 most-active suspected bot accounts alone were responsible for 22 % of all the links to these news and current events sites over the period in which this study was conducted . By contrast , the 500 most-active human accounts were responsible for just 6 % of all links to such sites .
An estimated 248,000 Hispanics of Venezuelan origin resided in the United States in 2013 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Census Bureau 's American Community Survey . Venezuelans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Venezuelan origin ; this means either they themselves are Venezuelan immigrants or they trace their family ancestry to Venezuela . Venezuelans are the 13th-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States , accounting for 0.5 % of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2013 . Since 1990 , the Venezuelan-origin population has grown more than fivefold , going from 49,000 to 248,000 over the period . At the same time , the foreign-born population of Venezuelan origin living in the U.S. grew by 388 % , up from 35,000 in 1990 to 170,000 in 2013 . In comparison , Mexicans , the nation 's largest Hispanic origin group , constituted 34.6 million , or 64.1 % , of the Hispanic population in 2013 .
Less than half – 2.3 million – of the nation 's unauthorized immigrants who potentially qualify for deportation relief and work permits under President Barack Obama 's executive actions live in the 26 states that have joined a lawsuit to stop the move , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis . Among the states that have joined the lawsuit , most of the unauthorized immigrants who potentially qualify for relief under the new executive actions are concentrated in just a handful of states . For example , half live in Texas ( 825,000 ) and Florida ( 300,000 ) . Four more states ( Arizona , Georgia , Nevada and North Carolina ) each have 100,000 or more of these immigrants .
Highly educated women are more likely to work during the pregnancy preceding their first birth than less educated women . The latest data indicate that 87 % of women with a bachelor 's degree or higher worked while pregnant with their first child . By contrast , just 28 % of women without a high school diploma worked while pregnant with their first child , a disparity that parallels full-time employment rates by educational attainment more broadly .
There 's more gray in the workforce . Americans ages 55 and older make up more than a fifth of the total labor force today ( 22.8 % , seasonally adjusted ) , compared with 17.6 % at the start of the Great Recession . Over the past decade , in fact , labor force participation has risen only among the 55-and-older contingent – from a seasonally adjusted 38.9 % in December 2007 to 39.8 % last month . ( That continued a trend that began in the mid-1990s , though for the past eight years the 55-and-older participation rate has been fairly level . ) As the population has aged and participation rates have fallen for people in their prime working years , 35- to 54-year-olds now account for just 41.4 % of the labor force ( seasonally adjusted ) , down from 46.4 % in December 2007 .
Climate change and ISIS are India 's top international concerns . Here , Indians are in agreement with Europeans , who also rank these two issues as the greatest threats to their countries . There have been no major ISIS-led attacks in India , but the terrorist organization has made threats against the country . Reflecting Indians ' positive views of the U.S. , American power and influence was viewed as the least threatening of the international issues tested . Similarly , few Indians view tensions with Russia as a cause for concern , but a much larger share sees China as threatening to their country .
In 2018 , 144 local TV stations changed hands at a cost of $ 8.8 billion , as annually reported by BIA Advisory Services . This is up from $ 4.7 billion across 107 stations that experienced changes in ownership in 2017 . )
A survey of 3,748 American-based scientists connected with the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) finds that 87 % agree with the statement `` Scientists should take an active role in public policy debates about issues related to science and technology . '' Just 13 % of these scientists back the opposite statement : `` Scientists should focus on establishing sound scientific facts and stay out of public policy debates . ''
More specifically , in the one-year period from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2010 , foreign-born workers gained 657,000 jobs and native-born workers gained 685,000 jobs . The unemployment rate dropped for both groups during this period . For immigrant workers it fell 0.2 percentage points ( from 10.1 % to 9.9 % ) and for native-born workers it decreased by about 0.5 percentage points ( from 9.5 % to 9.0 % ) . The fourth quarter of 2010 is the first period since the middle of 2008 that native-born workers have experienced positive jobs growth ( growth being measured as the change over the same quarter in the previous year ) . For foreign-born workers , the fourth quarter of 2010 marks the third successive period of jobs growth . Thus , the economic recovery now appears to be benefiting all workers , although the gains to native-born workers have been a bit later in coming . But the jobs recovery has been far from complete for either group of workers . From the beginning of the recession in the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2010 , native-born workers lost 6.1 million jobs , a drop of 4.9 % , and foreign-born workers lost 262,000 jobs , or a drop of 1.2 % . The unemployment rate for native-born workers is up from 4.6 % to 9.0 % and for immigrants it is up from 4.5 % to 9.9 % .
Democrats have grown less positive about elected officials who compromise . In the past , Democrats were more likely than Republicans to have positive views of elected officials who make compromises , but that is no longer true . Today , nearly equal shares in both parties ( 46 % of Democrats and 44 % of Republicans ) say `` they like elected officials who make compromises with people they disagree with . '' As recently as last year , Democrats were 23 percentage points more likely than Republicans to have positive views of elected officials who compromise .
The Chinese government recently announced it would further relax its decades-old one-child policy , but this shift might not dramatically affect the birth rate and the gender imbalance in China – at least not in the near term . China 's fertility rate certainly declined since the advent of the one-child policy in 1980 . But that decline seems to be a continuation of a trend that was already well underway prior to the policy 's official implementation . The country 's total fertility rate stood at almost six births per woman in the 1960s , but by 1980 , it had already fallen below three births per woman . As of 2013 , the typical Chinese woman was expected to have about 1.6 children in her lifetime .
Mexican unauthorized immigrant adults are more likely to be long-term residents of the U.S. As of 2017 , 83 % had lived in the U.S. for more than 10 years , while only 8 % had been in the country for five years or less . By comparison , 51 % of unauthorized immigrant adults from countries other than Mexico had lived in the U.S. a decade or more as of 2017 , while 30 % had lived in the U.S. for five years or less .
In 2008 , there were sizable differences in opinions about gay marriage among whites and blacks . While whites opposed gay marriage by a modest 51 % to 41 % margin , blacks opposed gay marriage by more than two-to-one ( 63 % to 26 % ) . But the gap has narrowed . Since 2008 , the proportion of African Americans favoring gay marriage has increased from 26 % to 39 % , while opposition has fallen from 63 % to 49 % . Support for gay marriage also has increased among whites , though far less dramatically ( from 41 % in 2008 to 47 % in the current survey ) .
Silents ' views were little changed in this period : About as many Silents say racial discrimination is the main obstacle to black people 's progress today as did so in 2000 ( 28 % now , 30 % then ) .
A 47-nation survey finds global public opinion increasingly wary of the world 's dominant nations and disapproving of their leaders . Anti-Americanism is extensive , as it has been for the past five years . At the same time , the image of China has slipped significantly among the publics of other major nations . Opinion about Russia is mixed , but confidence in its president , Vladimir Putin , has declined sharply . In fact , the Russian leader 's negatives have soared to the point that they mirror the nearly worldwide lack of confidence in George W. Bush .
Across the 14 countries surveyed , a median of 73 % say that their own country has done a good job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak . Just 27 % believe their country has handled it poorly . However , there is some variation by country on this assessment .
More Americans now think that members of Congress who support the Tea Party are having a negative effect than said that in January , at the start of the new Congress . Currently , 29 % judge the impact of Tea Party supporters as mostly negative compared with 22 % who see their impact as mostly positive . At the beginning of the year , the balance of opinion was just the opposite : 27 % said that Tea Party members in Congress would have a positive impact , while 18 % expected a negative effect .
Currently , 38 % say they followed news about the debt limit debate very closely , little different from the 34 % that said this one week earlier according to the latest Weekly News Interest Index survey , conducted July 21 - 24 among 999 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press . The survey was conducted before the prime-time speeches on July 25 by President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner . Public interest in the debt stalemate has risen over the past month , from 29 % during the first week of July to 38 % this week . Interest is well below the 47 % who tracked the budget showdown in early April , but that survey was conducted over the final weekend before a government shutdown loomed . The week earlier – roughly comparable in time to this week – just 30 % were following the shutdown debate very closely .
There are 25 women serving in the U.S. Senate , a historic high . Of these , 17 are Democrats and eight are Republicans . The first woman in the Senate was Rebecca Felton ( D-Ga. ) , who was appointed to the seat as a political maneuver in 1922 and served just one day . Nancy Kassebaum ( R-Kan. ) , who served in the Senate from 1978 to 1997 , was the first female senator who was not initially elected to fill an unexpired congressional term .
The president 's current job approval rating of 65 % is ten-points higher than in mid-March , before the start of military action in Iraq . Within the past month , it reached a peak of 74 % in polling the day U.S. troops successfully captured Baghdad .
While people in some EU countries support taking in refugees , there is widespread disapproval of how the EU has handled the refugee issue , the survey finds . In Greece , Sweden , Hungary and Italy , about eight-in-ten or more disapprove of the way the EU is dealing with the issue . In fact , across all 10 EU countries surveyed , majorities disapprove of how the EU is dealing with the refugee issue . In many countries , disapproval levels with how the EU has dealt with the refugee issue have exceeded disapproval rates of the EU 's handling of the economy , according to the Center 's spring 2017 survey . This suggests that the refugee issue is not simply a sign of broader disapproval of the EU .
While President Obama has touted the involvement of other countries in the military effort against Islamic militants , the public is skeptical of the contributions made by U.S. allies . Overall , just 17 % say countries that are allies with the U.S. are doing enough to help the U.S. military effort against militants in Iraq and Syria ; far more ( 73 % ) say they are not doing enough .
On views of the future international role of the European Union , a sizable majority of Americans believe the EU 's global standing will be unaffected by the crisis , while about a fifth believe it will increase or decrease , respectively .
Women are more likely than men to support raising the federal minimum wage to $ 15 an hour ( 72 % vs. 61 % , respectively ) . About nine-in-ten black Americans ( 93 % ) support this increase – including 80 % who express strong support – compared with about three-quarters of Hispanics ( 73 % ) and six-in-ten whites . In contrast , there are more modest ideological differences on this issue among Democrats . Overwhelming majorities of both liberal Democrats ( 91 % ) and conservative and moderate Democrats ( 82 % ) favor raising the minimum wage to $ 15 an hour , but liberal Democrats are substantially more likely to say they strongly favor this policy ( 68 % vs. 51 % ) .
The share of 18- to 24-year-olds who report having used online dating has nearly tripled in the last two years . Today 27 % of these young adults report that they have done so , up from just 10 % in early 2013 . Meanwhile , the share of 55- to 64-year-olds who use online dating has doubled over the same time period ( from 6 % in 2013 to 12 % in 2015 ) .
In 2017 , 21 women serve in the U.S. Senate and 83 serve in the House of Representatives , comprising 19.4 % of Congress . While this share is nearly nine times higher than it was in 1965 , it remains well below the 51.4 % of women in the overall U.S. adult population . ( An additional five women serve as nonvoting delegates in the House , representing American Samoa , the District of Columbia , Guam , Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands . )
Those self-identifying as disabled are somewhat more likely than the general public to report being particularly engaged with this election . In a survey conducted in June , fully 71 % of Americans with disabilities said it `` really matters who wins the election , '' compared with 59 % of Americans who do not have a disability .
Despite the progress that has been made , and widespread optimism about the future , people in sub-Saharan Africa still believe their countries need assistance from abroad . Across the nine nations in the study , a median of 68 % think their country needs more foreign aid than it gets today . The outlier is South Africa , where just 26 % hold this view .
To chart the progression of ideological thinking , responses to 10 political values questions asked on multiple Pew Research surveys since 1994 have been combined to create a measure of ideological consistency . Over the past twenty years , the number of Americans in the `` tails '' of this ideological distribution has doubled from 10 % to 21 % . Meanwhile , the center has shrunk : 39 % currently take a roughly equal number of liberal and conservative positions . That is down from about half ( 49 % ) of the public in surveys conducted in 1994 and 2004 .
As smartphone ownership has increased dramatically in recent years , more and more Americans are using their mobile devices to keep tabs on political events . Some 28 % of registered voters have used their cell phone this year to keep up with news relating to the election or political events , which represents a two-fold increase compared with the most recent midterm election cycle . In a survey conducted at the end of the 2010 election campaign , just 13 % of registered voters said that they had used their cell phones to keep up with election coverage . Registered voters of both parties are equally likely to use their phones to keep up with election news , as 25 % of Republicans and 29 % of Democrats report doing so this campaign season . And while voters of all ages are more likely to use their cell phones for political and election news than was the case during the 2010 midterms , this increase has been especially pronounced among voters in their 30s and 40s . Some 40 % of registered voters ages 30 - 49 have used their cell phones to track election coverage this year , up from just 15 % who did so during the previous midterm campaign .
Immigration , however , may be the issue on which Italy is most distinctive . Like much of Western Europe , over the last few years Italy has wrestled with how to successfully integrate and assimilate its Muslim minority . Additionally , the recent influx of Romanian immigrants — especially Roma , or gypsies from Romania — into Italy has led to new controversies over immigration . The 2007 Pew poll included a number of questions on immigration , and on each of these , Italians held the most negative opinions of any Western public.Nearly two-thirds of Italians ( 64 % ) believe immigration is a very big problem for their country . In no other Western nation did a majority rate immigration a very big problem ( Spain was the closest at 42 % ) . In fact , Italy 's level of concern was the highest , not only among Western countries , but among all 47 nations included in the survey . Similarly , roughly three-in-four Italians ( 73 % ) say immigrants are having a bad effect on their country , considerably more than any other Western public , and second only to South Africa ( 75 % ) among the 47 nations in the study .
Among Democrats , however , news interest plays a large role in whether they feel misunderstood . About a quarter of Democrats who are very interested in the news feel misunderstood ( 27 % ) , compared with about four-in-ten of the somewhat interested ( 39 % ) and roughly half of those not interested ( 52 % ) . Still , Democrats at all levels of news interest are much less likely than Republicans to feel misunderstood by the news media . ( For more on the measure of news interest , see this report . )
Women are more likely to have no schooling than men . Nearly a quarter ( 23 % ) of women are uneducated , compared with 14 % of the world 's men . In the least educated parts of the world ( Middle East-North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa ) roughly half of adult women have not been to school for even a year . In addition , older adults are more likely to have no education than younger ones . About a quarter of those who in 2010 were between the ages of 55 and 75 have no schooling . By contrast , among those who in 2010 were between the ages of 25 and 34 , the share without education is 15 % , a sign that more people are now going to school than four or five decades ago . Among the young , there also is less of a gender gap . Among men and women between the ages of 55 and 75 , 19 % and 34 % have no education , a 15 % difference . But among those between the ages of 25 and 34 , the gap between men with no schooling ( 12 % ) and women ( 19 % ) is only 7 % .
The new Pew Hispanic analysis finds that nearly four-in-five ( 79 % ) of the 5.1 million children ( younger than age 18 ) of unauthorized immigrants were born in this country and therefore are U.S. citizens . In total , 4 million U.S.-born children of unauthorized immigrant parents resided in this country in 2009 , alongside 1.1 million foreign-born children of unauthorized immigrant parents .
With the media and the public so highly focused on the economy and the presidential campaign last week , other news stories attracted relatively little attention . While 29 % of the public say they followed news about the current situation in Iraq very closely , only 2 % listed this as the single news story they were following more closely than any other . The media devoted 1 % of its overall coverage to events in Iraq .
Republicans and Democrats differ over the impact of billionaires . While a majority of Republicans ( 62 % ) say having billionaires in this country is neither bad nor good , more view this positively ( 28 % ) than negatively ( 9 % ) .
Democrats , regardless of ideology , support higher tax rates on corporations . But while 70 % of liberal Democrats say tax rates on household incomes over $ 250,000 should be raised , fewer than half of conservative and moderate Democrats ( 46 % ) say the same .
The collapse of Utah 's Crandall Canyon Mine that trapped six mine workers and led to a major rescue effort topped the public 's news interest last week . Overall , nearly three-in-ten Americans ( 28 % ) said it was the story they followed more closely than any other . The coal mining accident shared the public 's attention for the most closely followed story of the week with the war in Iraq ( 16 % most closely ) and the 2008 presidential campaign ( 11 % ) . U.S. economic conditions ( 9 % ) , hot weather ( 8 % ) , and the Barry Bonds record ( 7 % ) each was cited by fewer than one-in-ten Americans .
More Americans search for `` church '' around Easter than at any other time , with the Christmas season usually ranking second , according to Google Trends data between 2004 and 2013 . Google 's Trends tool measures the popularity of a search term relative to all searches in the United States . Data are reported on a scale from 0 to 100 .
Almost all of the quiz-takers ( 94 % ) say they have a library card , compared with 61 % of the general population , and 87 % have visited a library in the past year . Even more notably , 88 % have used a public library website in the past year—almost three times the rate of the Americans population overall ( 30 % ) . This is probably due to a basic self-selection bias : In general , people who are highly engaged with libraries are more likely to take a `` library user type '' quiz in the first place .
Growing wages for women have helped narrow the gender pay gap , though women still lag men in pay . Women 's median hourly earnings were $ 16.00 in 2016 , up from $ 12.48 in 1980 ( after adjusting for inflation ) . Men earned a median hourly wage of $ 19.23 in 2016 , down slightly from $ 19.42 in 1980 .
Views of China are also more positive in Brazil . While a slim majority of Brazilians ( 52 % ) give China high marks , fewer than half in Argentina ( 45 % ) and Mexico ( 39 % ) offer favorable opinions of the Asian superpower .
Since December 2012 , Obama has lost the most ground among independents : Currently , only 32 % of independents approve of his job performance while 61 % disapprove . In December , 53 % approved and 39 % disapproved . Obama 's current rating among independents is only slightly higher than Bush 's in November 2005 ( 29 % approved ) . Like Bush , Obama retains broad support among members of his own party , though the share of Democrats who give him a positive jobs rating has fallen 10 points over the past year ( from 88 % to 78 % ) . Obama 's job rating among Republicans , extremely low last December ( 12 % ) , has changed little since then .
Veterans who have served in the post-9/11 era have a more positive view than the general public about the overall worth of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and the tactics the military has used to wage them . Even so , in a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2011 , only one-third ( 34 % ) of these recent veterans said that both wars have been worth fighting ; nearly as many ( 33 % ) said neither conflict had been worth the costs . However , despite those mixed views and the hardships veterans have endured in the service and in their re-entry into civilian life , they have positive views of their experience .
Millennials also have more positive views of colleges and universities than those in older generations . Nearly three-quarters of Millennials ( 73 % ) say colleges and universities have a positive impact , compared with 64 % of Generation Xers , 59 % of Boomers and just 51 % of Silents .
As China 's economy has grown , so too has its role in world affairs . An increasingly assertive China has challenged the geopolitical balance of power in Asia and extended its economic reach in Africa , Latin America , Europe and elsewhere . The Chinese people recognize their country 's growing prominence : 75 % say China is playing a more important role in world affairs than it did 10 years ago . Only 10 % of the Chinese believe that they are a less powerful player in the global arena .
The U.S. foreign-born population reached a record 44.8 million in 2018 . Since 1965 , when U.S. immigration laws replaced a national quota system , the number of immigrants living in the U.S. has more than quadrupled . Immigrants today account for 13.7 % of the U.S. population , nearly triple the share ( 4.8 % ) in 1970 . However , today 's immigrant share remains below the record 14.8 % share in 1890 , when 9.2 million immigrants lived in the U.S .
Young people continue to be the strongest proponents of same-sex marriage . And as public support for same-sex marriage continues to grow , the gap between young and old is nowhere more striking than within the Republican coalition . Today , 61 % of Republicans and Republican leaners under 30 favor same-sex marriage while just 35 % oppose it . By contrast , just 27 % of Republicans ages 50 and older favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry . This generation gap among Republicans comes against a backdrop of rapidly changing public opinion overall on the issue . More than half the public ( 54 % ) now favors allowing gays and lesbians to legally marry , a record high in Pew Research surveys , in keeping with findings from other recent polls . Democrats and Republicans remain on opposite sides of the issue , with 69 % of Democrats and Democratic leaning independents favoring same-sex marriage compared with 39 % Republicans and Republican leaners . On this issue , young Republicans ' views are more in line with Democrats . And while support for gay marriage is higher among younger Democrats and Democratic leaners than older Democrats , even Democrats 65 and older favor same-sex marriage by a margin of about two-to-one .
Among the 14 advanced economies surveyed , most rate China 's COVID-19 response negatively . A median of 61 % say China has done a bad job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak , while 37 % believe the country has done a good job .
More than twice as many Indians are dissatisfied as satisfied with the way things are going in the country ( 70 % vs. 29 % ) . And this discontent is shared by those who would like to see the Hindu-nationalist opposition Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) lead the next Indian government , those who prefer the current governing coalition led by the left-of-center Indian National Congress ( Congress ) party and those who favor some other party to lead .
The sentiments against political ads extend across most groups , though there are some differences tied to factors like partisanship and age . For instance , just 15 % of Democrats and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party say that social media companies should allow all political ads on their platforms , compared with 38 % of Republicans and GOP leaners . Some 27 % of Democrats say only some political ads should be allowed on these platforms , compared with a much smaller share of Republicans ( 10 % ) who say the same . When it comes to not allowing any political ads on these sites at all , 56 % of Democrats and half of Republicans express this view .
Among the public , three-in-ten ( 32 % ) followed Obama 's appointments and plans very closely , making it among the most closely followed stories of the week . One-in-four ( 24 % ) say that the transition was the story they followed most closely . Reports about President Bush 's last days in the White House were followed very closely by 12 % of the public ; this was the top story for 1 % of Americans . These stories accounted for 1 % of total news .
While curiosity was the most common reason given across topics , those most interested in food and nutrition were less curiosity-driven and less likely to see enjoyment in talking about science as a reason for following science news . Additionally , space and astronomy enthusiasts were least likely to say they follow science news because it helps them make decisions about their everyday lives ( 40 % , vs. 55 % or higher among those most interested in other topics listed ) .
The biggest gap between the way Americans are seen by other Western countries , and the way they see themselves , is with respect to religion . Majorities in France and the Netherlands and pluralities in Great Britain and Germany see the U.S. as too religious . By contrast , a 58 % majority of Americans say their country is not religious enough . On this point , Muslims find themselves in rare agreement with the American public ; majorities in Indonesia , Pakistan , Lebanon and Turkey all believe the U.S. is not religious enough .
There also are some differences in their views of important issues , including immigration . Muslim Republicans are much more likely than Muslim Democrats ( 45 % vs. 11 % ) to say immigrants are a burden to society because they take jobs , housing and healthcare , according to a survey conducted by the Center between January and May 2017 . There also is partisan divide on this issue among those in the public overall , according to a separate survey conducted in June and July 2017 .
Fourth , the survey finds that the broader public has decidedly mixed views about jobs in the emerging gig economy . On one hand , a majority of Americans feel that these jobs are good options for people who want a flexible work schedule ( 68 % ) or for older adults who do n't want to work full time any more ( 54 % ) . On the other hand , around one-in-five feel that these jobs place too much financial burden on workers ( 21 % ) and let companies take advantage of workers ( 23 % ) , while just 16 % feel that this type of work offers jobs that people can build careers out of .
Public interest in news about Egypt is higher than it has been in the past few months . But it is far lower than during the Arab Spring two years ago . In the current survey , 22 % say they are following news about political violence in Egypt very closely . In February 2011 , when former President Hosni Mubarak resigned after weeks of public protests , 39 % were following events in Egpt very closely .
Currently , Democrats are more definite about their general election preferences than are Republicans : 73 % of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they will definitely vote for the party 's nominee , while 59 % of Republican and Republican-leaning voters say they will definitely vote for Trump . The survey was conducted before Trump 's Senate impeachment trial . ( See this report for views of the Senate trial and Donald Trump . ) Yet Republicans are far more confident of victory in November . Nearly four-in-ten Republican voters ( 38 % ) think Trump will definitely win reelection , while another 41 % say he will probably win . Among Democratic voters , just 11 % say the Democratic candidate will definitely win , while 32 % see a Democratic victory as probable . Democratic voters are far more likely than Republicans to decline to express an opinion about the outcome ( 34 % vs. 15 % ) .
By a 48 % -40 % margin , more Americans continue to say they think a health care reform bill will pass over the next year than say they do not think that will happen . Opinion on this question is virtually identical to that measured a week earlier . House passage of health care legislation late Saturday , Nov. 7 , had little effect on public attitudes : opinions measured in the two days after passage were not significantly different than those measured in the two days leading up to the vote . The partisan divide over the prospects for health care reform also remains . A broad majority of Democrats ( 62 % ) say they expect a bill to pass over the next year ; about a quarter ( 27 % ) do not think reform will happen . Republicans and independents are much more mixed in their views : 42 % of Republicans expect a bill to pass , half ( 50 % ) do not . Among independents , 43 % think health care reform will happen over the next year , while a comparable percentage ( 46 % ) do not think a bill will pass .
Despite concern about a wide range of issues , many are satisfied with their economic situation . Majorities in China have consistently rated their personal economic situation positively . In 2008 , 66 % of Chinese said their personal finances were good . In 2015 , 72 % hold this view . Roughly three-quarters of Chinese ( 77 % ) believe their family is better off today than they were five years ago . Only 4 % say they are worse off financially than they were five years ago and 17 % say they are about the same . Not only do many Chinese rate the current state of their finances positively , but an overwhelming majority sees the effects of China 's economic advancement over the past generation . Nearly all Chinese ( 96 % ) say their current standard of living is better than their parents ' standard of living at the same age . This is relatively unchanged from 2012 , when 92 % of Chinese said their standard of living was superior to that of their parents ' generation .
About three-in-ten ( 31 % ) say they followed the discussions about how to address the federal deficit and national debt more closely than any other story . Another 14 % say they most closely followed news about the conditi0n of the nation 's struggling economy , according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey conducted July 14 - 17 among 1,006 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press . News about the debt limit debate made up 31 % of the newshole , much more than any other story . More general news about the state of the economy accounted for 4 % of coverage , while state and local budget woes accounted for another 1 % , according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism ( PEJ ) .
Though growth in smartphone ownership has occurred up and down the economic spectrum , adoption still varies significantly by household income . However , that variation is unevenly distributed across different age groups . Younger adults—regardless of income level—are very likely to be smartphone owners . Conversely , for older adults smartphone ownership is more of an `` elite '' phenomenon : smartphones tend to be quite prevalent at the upper end of the income distribution but much less common among those with lower income levels .
With the Nov. 2 elections fast approaching , the percent of the public tracking election news very closely jumped to 33 % from 23 % one week earlier .
A median of nearly two-thirds ( 65 % ) across 44 countries surveyed in spring 2014 responded that they were having a typical day . Only around a quarter ( 27 % ) said their day was going particularly well , and not even one-in-ten ( 7 % ) admitted their day was going poorly .
In 2018 , nearly half ( 47 % ) of the world 's resettled refugees were from Middle Eastern countries , while almost one-third ( 32 % ) were from Africa . People from Middle Eastern countries – mostly Syria and Iraq – accounted for 49 % of resettled refugees in Australia , 55 % in Canada and 85 % in the UK . By contrast , fewer than 1 % of refugees resettled in the U.S. in 2018 were from the Middle East , in part due to shifting regional caps . Most resettled refugees in the U.S. were from countries in Africa ( 51 % ) or Asia ( 27 % ) .
Apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border more than doubled between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 but remained below historical highs . There were 851,508 apprehensions in the 2019 fiscal year ( October 2018-September 2019 ) , a 115 % increase from the previous fiscal year and the highest total in 12 years . Still , the total remained far below the 1,643,679 apprehensions recorded in 2000 , the peak year . And apprehensions regularly exceeded 1 million per fiscal year during the 1980s , 1990s and 2000s . There has been a major shift in who is being apprehended , with non-Mexicans now far outnumbering Mexicans . Non-Mexicans accounted for 80 % of apprehensions in fiscal 2019 , marking the fourth consecutive year in which they outnumbered Mexicans . In 2000 ( the earliest year for which data is available ) , non-Mexicans accounted for just 2 % of apprehensions while Mexicans accounted for 98 % .
To date , 44 women have served as governors in 30 states . In 2019 , six Democratic and three Republican women are serving as governors . Nellie Tayloe Ross of Wyoming , a Democrat , was the first female governor ; she was elected in a special election in 1924 to succeed her deceased husband . Ella Grasso , a Connecticut Democrat , was the first female governor elected in her own right , in 1975 .
Hillary Clinton is hoping to make history on Tuesday by being elected the nation 's first woman president . While the impact of Clinton 's gender on her candidacy is viewed very differently by her supporters and voters who back Donald Trump , there also is a gender gap among Clinton 's supporters . Half of Clinton supporters think she is being held to a higher standard than past presidential candidates because she is a woman ; just 11 % of Trump supporters say the same , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Oct. 20 - 25 . But women who back Clinton are far more likely than her male supporters to say she is being held to a higher standard . A majority of women who back Clinton ( 57 % ) express this view , compared with 34 % who say her gender is not a factor . Among men who back Clinton , opinion is nearly the reverse : 52 % say Clinton 's gender is not a factor , while 40 % say she is held to a higher standard than prior presidential candidates . Very few of Clinton 's male ( 6 % ) or female ( 8 % ) supporters think she is treated less critically because of her gender .
The Pew Research Center survey , conducted May 12 - 18 among 2,002 adults , finds that partisans are as divided on this issue as ever : Today , 65 % of Democrats and an identical percentage of independents favor gay marriage ; only about one third ( 34 % ) of Republicans do so . Growing shares of all three groups support same-sex marriage , yet the differences between Democrats and Republicans are as wide today as they were a decade ago . However , with same-sex marriage legal in 36 states ( and the District of Columbia ) and the possibility of a Supreme Court decision on its nationwide status , Republicans ( 72 % ) are just as likely as Democrats ( 72 % ) and independents ( 74 % ) to say that it is `` inevitable '' that same-sex marriage will be legally recognized .
In a week when the media focused heavily on Barack Obama 's first State of the Union address and the state of the economy , Americans continued to track news about the earthquake in Haiti more closely than any other major news story . Four-in-ten say they followed news about the aftermath of the earthquake and relief efforts `` most closely '' last week , far more than said the same about the debate over health care reform ( 18 % ) or reports about the condition of the U.S. economy ( 15 % ) . Fewer that one-in-ten ( 8 % ) say they followed news about the State of the Union speech more closely than any other story , according to the latest News Interest Index survey , conducted Jan. 29 to Feb. 1 among 1,020 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press . The media , on the other hand , gave the most coverage to the president 's speech ( 19 % ) and news about the economic crisis ( 18 % ) , according to the separate analysis by the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism . Reporting on the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake made up 11 % of the newshole examined .
The U.S. image remains abysmal in most Muslim countries in the Middle East and Asia , and continues to decline among the publics of many of America 's oldest allies . Favorable views of the U.S. are in single digits in Turkey ( 9 % ) and have declined to 15 % in Pakistan . Currently , just 30 % of Germans have a positive view of the U.S. — down from 42 % as recently as two years ago — and favorable ratings inch ever lower in Great Britain and Canada .
Are you planning to wish your mom a Happy Mother 's Day on Facebook ? If so , you 're not alone . `` Moms '' ( defined as women with a child or children under the age of 18 living at home ) are especially likely to be Facebook users , even compared with dads , or with other women , according to Pew Research Center 's 2012 data on social networking . Some 79 % of moms use Facebook , compared with 61 % of all women and 57 % of men with a minor child living at home . ( As of December 2012 , 54 % of all American adults and 67 % of internet users use social networking sites . ) Perhaps it 's not surprising so many moms are on Facebook . Women surpassed men in their social networking site usage several years ago and since then they have been consistently more likely than men to use online social networks .
However , the public does pay attention to certain high-profile Supreme Court cases . Many ( 45 % ) paid close attention to the 2012 Affordable Care Act ruling , last year 's same-sex marriage decisions ( 30 % ) and 2012 's ruling on Arizona 's strict immigration law ( 29 % ) .
The black-white income gap in the U.S. has persisted over time . The difference in median household incomes between white and black Americans has grown from about $ 23,800 in 1970 to roughly $ 33,000 in 2018 ( as measured in 2018 dollars ) . Median black household income was 61 % of median white household income in 2018 , up modestly from 56 % in 1970 – but down slightly from 63 % in 2007 , before the Great Recession , according to Current Population Survey data .
Catholics in these three metro areas all tend to have at least somewhat higher household incomes than do U.S. Catholics overall , perhaps reflecting the higher cost of living in these areas . Catholics in the D.C. area have especially high incomes : 29 % of Washington Catholics report household incomes of $ 100,000 per year or more , compared with 19 % of all U.S. Catholics who are in this income bracket .
Most Americans consider their future health within their grasp – if only they eat and exercise adequately . Roughly seven-in-ten adults say that healthy eating habits ( 72 % ) and getting enough physical exercise ( 71 % ) are very important for improving a person 's chances of living a long and healthy life .
The overall percentage of lawful immigrants to the United States choosing to apply for and gaining citizenship is at its highest level in more than two decades . Yet in terms of naturalization rate , Mexicans – the single largest group of lawful immigrants by country of origin – lag well behind green-card holders eligible to apply from other parts of the globe . Based on Pew Research Center estimates using the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data available , two-thirds ( 67 % ) of lawful immigrants eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship had applied for and obtained citizenship by 2015 . This is the highest share since at least the mid-1990s . But among Mexican lawful immigrants eligible to apply , only 42 % had applied for and obtained U.S. citizenship by 2015 , a rate little changed since 2005 and one of the lowest among all immigrant groups when it comes to country of origin . As part of a larger survey of Hispanic immigrants fielded in late 2015 , Pew Research Center asked Mexican green-card holders why they had not yet become naturalized U.S. citizens . The most frequent reasons centered on inadequate English skills , lack of time or initiative , and the cost of the U.S. citizenship application . These appear to be significant barriers , as nearly all lawful immigrants from Mexico said they would like to become U.S. citizens someday . In the United States , the citizenship , or naturalization , rate among all lawful immigrants steadily increased from 1995 to 2005 , rising from 47 % to 62 % . Until about 2005 , the naturalization rate among lawful immigrants from Mexico also increased steadily , but did so more rapidly ( from 20 % in 1995 to 38 % in 2005 ) , narrowing the gap between Mexicans and other immigrants . However , between 2005 and 2010 , the naturalization rate of Mexican green-card holders leveled off , even as the rate for lawful permanent residents from other parts of the globe continued to rise . Only in the period from 2011 to 2015 did the rate of naturalization among eligible Mexican immigrants significantly increase again at a pace higher than that of other lawful U.S. immigrants – going from 38 % to 42 % among Mexicans , compared with a 2-percentage-point increase , from 72 % to 74 % among non-Mexican immigrants .
Roughly a quarter century after the end of the Soviet era , Russia retains substantial influence throughout many parts of Central and Eastern Europe . Indeed , Russia is widely viewed by the region 's Orthodox Christians as an important counterweight to Western influences and as a global protector of Orthodox and ethnic Russian populations , according to a new Pew Research Center survey of 18 countries in Central and Eastern Europe . Majorities or pluralities in nearly all Orthodox-majority countries surveyed agree that a strong Russia is necessary to balance the influence of the West , and that Russia has an obligation to protect Orthodox Christians and ethnic Russians outside its borders .
The United States plans to admit a maximum of 18,000 refugees in fiscal year 2020 , down from a cap of 30,000 in the one that ended Sept. 30 , 2019 , under a new refugee admissions ceiling set by the Trump administration . This would be the lowest number of refugees resettled by the U.S. in a single year since 1980 , when Congress created the nation 's refugee resettlement program . Refugee admissions into the U.S. have declined substantially during Donald Trump 's presidency . Every fall , the U.S. president sets a refugee ceiling – the maximum number of refugees who may enter the country in a fiscal year . In fiscal 2017 ( Oct. 1 , 2016 , to Sept. 30 , 2017 ) , about 53,700 refugees resettled in the U.S. – a figure that reflects a temporary freeze on refugee admissions that Trump ordered shortly after taking office . The following year , Trump 's first full fiscal year in office , he set the nation 's refugee ceiling at 45,000 , a new low at the time , and the U.S. ultimately admitted about 22,500 . Trump then set the refugee ceiling at 30,000 for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 , 2019 , and refugee admissions reached this cap . For fiscal 2020 , which started Oct. 1 , 2019 , Trump has set a ceiling of 18,000 refugees . Overall , the U.S. has admitted about 76,200 refugees so far under the Trump administration ( Jan. 20 , 2017 , to Sept. 30 , 2019 ) . By comparison , the U.S. admitted nearly 85,000 refugees in fiscal 2016 alone , the last full fiscal year of the Obama administration . Historically , the total number of refugees coming to the U.S. has fluctuated with global events and U.S. priorities . From fiscal years 1990 to 1995 , an average of about 116,000 refugees arrived in the U.S. each year , with many coming from the former Soviet Union . However , refugee admissions dropped off to roughly 27,100 in fiscal 2002 , a new low at the time , after the U.S. largely suspended admissions following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks . Refugee admissions rebounded from this low point . From fiscal 2008 to 2017 , an average of about 67,100 refugees arrived each year . Half or more of refugees during this time came from Asia , with many from Iraq and Burma ( Myanmar ) . ( Iraq is counted as a part of Asia in this data source . ) Since fiscal 1980 , 55 % of refugees have come from Asia , a far higher share than from Europe ( 28 % ) , Africa ( 13 % ) or Latin America ( 4 % ) .
Voter enthusiasm is at its highest level during any midterm in more than 20 years . Two-thirds of Democratic voters ( 67 % ) and 59 % of Republican voters say they are more enthusiastic than usual about voting than in past congressional elections . Democrats in particular are much more enthusiastic than at similar points in previous midterms . Four years ago , just 36 % of Democratic voters said they were more enthusiastic about voting than usual . Among Republicans , there has been less change ( 52 % then , 59 % today ) .
With many nations under stay-at-home orders and work restrictions due to the COVID-19 crisis , remittances – money sent by migrants to their home countries – are projected to fall by a record 20 % this year . This decline , from a high of $ 714 billion in 2019 to an estimated $ 572 billion in 2020 , comes as the world 's largest remittance-sending nations have experienced especially stringent lockdowns , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the World Bank , Oxford University and Google . The decline in remittances is projected to hit all regions of the world , as many of the 272 million international migrants lose their jobs and stop sending money home . Remittances to European and Central Asian countries the World Bank defines as low and middle income are projected to decline by 28 % , while slightly smaller declines are expected for low- and middle-income nations in sub-Saharan Africa ( 23 % ) , South Asia ( 22 % ) , Latin America and the Caribbean ( 19 % ) , and the Middle East and North Africa ( 20 % ) , according to the World Bank . These projections are based on information about prevailing wages and the number of international migrants in each country . It is not unusual for worldwide remittances from migrants to ebb and flow with economic circumstances in sending countries . In 2009 , during the Great Recession , global remittances declined 5 % as economies shrank . And in 2016 , remittances fell 1 % , driven by weak growth in many countries and declining oil prices . Remittances can also increase during hard times in migrants ' home countries . For example , remittances to Yemen more than doubled between 2011 and 2019 amid a civil war in that country .
It 's harder for new graduates to find good jobs . It 's no secret that unemployment among recent grads remains higher than it was before the Great Recession . But in a recent report , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York went deeper and looked at underemployment among recent grads ( defined as people aged 22 to 27 with at least a bachelor 's degree ) . The Fed researchers used data from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to examine whether employed grads were in jobs that typically required a college degree , what those jobs paid , and whether they were working full- or part-time . They found that in 2012 , about 44 % of grads were working in jobs that did n't require a college degree — a rate that , while about what it was in early 1990s , increased after the 2001 and 2007 - 09 recessions . Only 36 % of that group were in what the researchers called `` good non-college jobs '' — those paying around $ 45,000 a year — down from around half in the 1990s . The share of underemployed recent grads in low-wage ( below $ 25,000 ) jobs rose from about 15 % in 1990 to more than 20 % . About one-in-five ( 23 % ) underemployed recent grads were working part-time in 2011 , up from 15 % in 2000 .
Should all of President-elect Donald Trump 's Cabinet nominees eventually be confirmed , he will start his administration with one of the most heavily business-oriented Cabinets in U.S. history . Five of the 15 people Trump has nominated to be Cabinet secretaries have spent all or nearly all their careers in the business world , with no significant public office or senior military service on their résumés . That would be more businesspeople with no public-sector experience than have ever served in the Cabinet at any one time , according to a review and analysis by the Pew Research Center . Even accounting for the growth of the Cabinet over time , Trump would be in the top tier in terms of the percentage of career businesspeople as Cabinet secretaries . A third of the department heads in the Trump administration ( 33 % ) will be people whose prior experience has been entirely in the public sector . Only three other presidents are in the same range : William McKinley ( three out eight Cabinet positions , or 37.5 % ) , Ronald Reagan ( four out of 13 positions , or 31 % ) , and Dwight Eisenhower ( three out of 10 positions , or 30 % ) .
But far smaller shares of the public expect that Trump and Democrats will work together : Half of Americans say it is at least somewhat likely Trump will work with Democrats in Washington to address important issues facing the country , while roughly as many ( 47 % ) expect Democrats in Washington will work with Trump . Democrats , in particular , are skeptical that Trump will cooperate with their party : Just 31 % of Democrats ( compared with 73 % of Republicans ) say Trump is likely to work with Democrats in Washington .
Today , more than six-in-ten ( 61 % ) Latinos say that discrimination against Hispanics is a `` major problem , '' up from 54 % who said that in 2007 . Asked to state the most important factor leading to discrimination , a plurality of 36 % now cites immigration status , up from a minority of 23 % who said the same in 2007 . Back then , a plurality of respondents—46 % —identified language skills as the biggest cause of discrimination against Hispanics ( Pew Hispanic Center , 2007 ) . The native born and foreign born have different views on many topics explored in the survey . For example , seven-in-ten ( 70 % ) foreign-born Latinos say discrimination against Hispanics is a major problem preventing Latinos from succeeding in America . Less than half ( 49 % ) of the native born agree . And when it comes to their views of immigrants , fewer than seven-in-ten native-born Hispanics say immigrants strengthen the country , while 85 % of immigrant Hispanics say the same .
The disparate trends in the jobs recovery from 2009 to 2011 reflect the rapidly changing demographics of the American workforce . Although jobs growth for Hispanics and Asians was more rapid than for other groups , it merely kept pace with the growth in their working-age ( ages 16 and older ) populations . The slower rate of jobs growth for whites and blacks reflects the relatively slow growth in their populations . Thus , the share of each group 's population that is employed , the employment rate , has barely risen since the end of the recession , according to new Pew Research Center analysis of government data .
When asked to elaborate on the main reason why they think social media have a mostly negative effect on the way things are going in this country today , roughly three-in-ten ( 28 % ) respondents who hold that view mention the spreading of misinformation and made-up news . Smaller shares reference examples of hate , harassment , conflict and extremism ( 16 % ) as a main reason , and 11 % mention a perceived lack of critical thinking skills among many users – voicing concern about people who use these sites believing everything they see or read or being unsure about what to believe .
Republicans hold a 49 % -40 % lead over the Democrats in leaned party identification among whites . The Democrats hold an 80 % -11 % advantage among blacks , and lead by more than two-to-one among Hispanics ( 56 % -26 % ) . Asian Americans also lean Democratic by a wide margin ( 65 % -23 % ) . This data for Asian Americans is based on interviews conducted in English . Back to top
While al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden inspired substantial confidence in a few predominately Muslim countries in 2003 , his popularity has plummeted in recent years . Confidence among Jordanian Muslims has dropped from 56 % in 2003 to 19 % in 2008 ; a mere 2 % of Muslims in Lebanon and 3 % in Turkey said in 2008 that they were confident bin Laden would do the right thing in world affairs .
About one-in-ten ( 12 % ) say they very closely followed news about Steve Jobs announcing he is stepping down as Apple 's chief executive officer ; 3 % say this was the news they followed most closely . The Apple developments accounted for 2 % of the newshole measured by PEJ .
However , 29 % of LGBT adults also said they had been made to feel unwelcome in a church or other place of worship . Many also rated specific religious groups as unfriendly toward the LGBT community , including eight-in-ten ( 79 % ) who said the Catholic Church is unfriendly toward LGBT people .
Sharing ideas : In addition , 72 % of internet users say digital technologies have improved their ability to share their ideas and creations with others . These figures have risen since 2006 , when we found that 55 % of online adults felt the internet improved their ability to share their ideas and creations . It is likely that a major contributor to the increase in this measurement is the rise of social networking sites , which were not heavily in use in in 2006 . Social networking sites are used by more than two-thirds of those who go online now .
But in addition to the generation 's Democratic tendency , Millennials who identify with the GOP are also less conservative than Republicans in other generations : Among the roughly one-third of Millennials who affiliate with or lean Republican , just 31 % have a mix of political values that are right-of-center , while about half ( 51 % ) take a mix of liberal and conservative positions and 18 % have consistently or mostly liberal views . Among all Republicans and Republican leaners , 53 % have conservative views ; in the two oldest generations , Silents and Boomers , about two-thirds are consistently or mostly conservative . By a 64 % to 30 % margin Millennial Republicans say that homosexuality should be accepted by society rather than discouraged . Among older generations of Republicans , no more than about half think homosexuality should be accepted . There is a similar generational split in the GOP over immigration : On balance , younger Republicans say immigrants strengthen our country with their hard work and talents , while older Republicans say immigrants are a burden on our country by taking our jobs , housing and health care . The generational divide in the GOP carries over to views of business and regulation as well . While Boomer and Silent Generation Republicans overwhelmingly see stricter environmental regulations as hurting the economy , Millennial Republicans are divided almost evenly over whether this is the case or whether they are worth the costs . Similarly , older generations of Republicans believe business corporations make a fair and reasonable amount of profit these days , while half of Millennial Republicans think they make too much profit .
First , they are the only generation to have recovered the home equity they lost in the downturn . The typical home equity level of Gen X homeowners has doubled since 2010 , though this was not achieved without considerable borrower distress . According to Federal Reserve data , 15 % of Gen X 's homeowners were `` underwater '' on their homes in 2010 ( meaning they owed more than they owned ) . By 2016 only 3 % were underwater . This improvement is due to lenders foreclosing on homeowners as well as appreciating home values and mortgage modifications . Still , reducing the ranks of homeowners with negative equity in their homes boosts wealth .
While half of Americans believe China will emerge from the current crisis with less influence in world affairs , far fewer say this about the U.S. or the European Union .
Just over half of the public ( 53 % ) say they followed news about Hurricane Sandy and the storm 's impact very closely last week , outpacing interest in the 2012 presidential election ( 47 % very closely ) and news about the U.S. economy ( 38 % very closely ) .
Hispanics continue to punch below their weight . Much was made right after the November election about the clout of the Hispanic vote ( by , among others , the Pew Research Center ) . But the new Census Bureau data show that Hispanics ' turnout rate—just 48 % —was far below that of whites ( 64.1 % ) or blacks ( 66.2 % ) . It also fell nearly two percentage points below the Hispanic turnout rate in 2008 , which was 49.9 % . Because of population growth , the number of Latinos who voted for president increased by about 1.4 million from 2008 to 2012 , to a record 11.2 million , but the number of Latinos who were eligible but chose not to vote increased even more—by 2.3 million—from 9.8 million in 2008 to 12.1 million in 2012 .
Despite these more negative views about progress in Iraq , there has been no significant increase in the number of Americans calling for a troop withdrawal of U.S. forces . The public remains divided over whether the U.S. should bring its troops home as soon as possible ( 48 % ) or keep troops in Iraq until the situation has stabilized ( 46 % ) .
In other news , 28 % of the public followed news about the Iraq war very closely ( up slightly from 23 % last week ) . Iraq was the most closely followed story for 13 % of the public . The national media devoted 2 % of its coverage to the war .
The recent decline in Trump 's job approval can be seen across most demographic and political groups . For instance , Republicans and Republican leaners are now 7 percentage points less likely to say they approve of Trump than in March ( 78 % , vs. 85 % then ) . Among Democrats and Democratic leaners , Trump 's approval rating is down 6 points over this period of time ( from 12 % in March to 6 % today ) . The partisan gap in ratings of Trump remains as wide or wider than those seen for other previous U.S. presidents in the polling era .
On the same survey , we asked respondents for the first time whether they think businesses that provide wedding services should be allowed to refuse to serve same-sex couples for religious reasons . On this issue , blacks stand out as especially likely to say that such businesses should be required to provide the same services to gay and lesbian couples as they would to all other customers . About six-in-ten African Americans ( 61 % ) say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve same-sex couples , compared with 45 % of whites who say the same .
Early in the course of the pandemic , the health impacts were felt most severely in dense urban centers . From March to May , congressional districts in the most urbanized parts of the country were experiencing about five times as many deaths on average compared with those in the least dense parts of the country , and in some places this disparity was much larger . However , by the summertime the urban-rural split had largely disappeared , and over the last several months , those districts with small shares of residents in densely populated places have been experiencing twice as many deaths as those in the parts of the country where all or nearly all residents live in urban neighborhoods .
Overall , 52 % of adults say they `` feel more comfortable using familiar brands and products , '' and 39 % describe themselves as preferring to wait until they hear about others ' experiences before trying something new themselves . Similarly , 39 % say they prefer their `` tried and trusted '' brands . But 35 % of Americans say they like the variety of trying new products , and three-in-ten like being able to tell others about their experiences with new technology . About one-in-six adults ( 15 % ) say they usually try technology products before others do .
Online Americans in the higher-income bracket are fully engaged with seeking heath information and conducting other health-related activities online .3 Internet users in the top income brackets are more likely to search for medical information online , seek treatment information , seek material about doctors and medical facilities , and get data concerning test results .
Social networking sites ( SNS ) stand in contrast to these other venues . Political engagement on social networking sites is especially commonplace among the youngest Americans , as two-thirds ( 67 % ) of all 18 - 24 year olds ( and nearly three quarters of those young adults who use social networking sites ) engaged in some sort of social network-related political activity in the 12 months preceding our survey . Indeed , the youngest American adults are more likely to engage in political behaviors on social networking sites than in any other venue . Older adults tend to be fairly politically active on social networking sites to the extent that they use them , but are relatively unlikely to use these sites in the first place . So , although nearly six in ten SNS-using seniors are politically active on these sites , that works out to just 13 % of all Americans in the 65+ age group .
A substantial majority of Americans ( 76 % ) feel that both spending cuts and tax increases should be a part of the next step in tackling the federal budget deficit . But an equally large proportion believes that the greater share should come from spending cuts , even if tax hikes are also considered .
About two-thirds of Hispanics with darker skin colors ( 64 % ) report they have experienced discrimination or been treated unfairly regularly or from time to time , compared with half of those with a lighter skin tone . These differences in experiences with discrimination hold even after controlling for characteristics such as gender , age , education and whether they were born in the U.S. or abroad .
Publicly funded news media also tend to be more trusted than privately funded organizations – both in general and when it comes to specific news outlets . For example , about three-quarters ( 73 % ) of Swedes and 71 % of British adults say they trust the public media more than private . In Spain and Italy , publics are more divided on the issue .
Joblessness among blacks and Hispanics continues to be well above that of whites , and remains higher for all racial groups than before the Great Recession . However , unemployment is falling faster among blacks than among whites : The jobless rate among blacks fell nine-tenths of a percentage point last month , as 228,000 more adults found work . Since black unemployment peaked at 16.8 % in March 2010 , it 's fallen 4.2 percentage points , to 12.6 % . White unemployment peaked much lower than that of blacks — 9.2 % in November 2009 — but has fallen by a lesser amount since then : 2.6 percentage points , to 6.6 % last month . The number of employed and unemployed whites fell in July , while the number not counted as being the labor force — due to retirement , going back to school , or simply giving up on looking for work — rose for the second month in a row .
Opinion about whether to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq has remained stable for most of this year . Currently , 54 % support a troop withdrawal , which is virtually unchanged from measures dating back to February . In mid-January , following Bush 's speech announcing the surge , there was a modest decline in support for a troop withdrawal ; 48 % supported bringing the troops home as soon as possible , down five points from a survey conducted earlier in the month ( 53 % ) . But the proportion favoring a troop withdrawal rebounded to 53 % in February . It has remained at about that level since then .
About half of U.S. adults ( 51 % ) say transgender individuals should be allowed to use public restrooms that correspond with the gender they currently identify with , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . But nearly as many ( 46 % ) take the opposite position – on the side of the North Carolina law – and say transgender people should be required to use bathrooms that match the gender they were born into . Religion , age , gender and politics are all connected with views on this issue . For instance , a majority of Americans who say they attend religious services at least weekly – especially white evangelicals – say transgender people should be required to use bathrooms of their gender at birth , while most of those who attend services less often ( particularly people who do not identify with any religion ) take the more liberal position that such individuals should be allowed to use bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity . Also , more women than men take the liberal stance ( 55 % vs. 45 % ) as do young adults when compared with older Americans ( 67 % of those ages 18 to 29 , compared with about half or fewer in older age groups ) . In addition , those who are Democrats or who lean Democratic are far more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners ( 68 % vs. 30 % ) to say transgender people should be able to use the bathroom that fits their gender identity . In addition , people who say they personally know someone who is transgender are more likely than those who do not to say transgender people should be allowed to use public bathrooms that match their current gender identity ( 60 % vs. 47 % ) . But only 30 % of U.S. adults say they know someone who is transgender – far lower than the share of Americans who know someone who is gay ( 87 % ) .
The Republican Party has traditionally garnered it strongest backing among wealthier voters . But the recent overall decline in Republican Party affiliation nationwide has taken a toll even on GOP support among affluent voters . The latest Pew surveys find Democrats pulling even with Republicans among registered voters with annual family incomes in excess of roughly $ 135,000 per annum . Overall , while remarkably high voter enthusiasm is undoubtedly the key factor in the Democratic Party 's fundraising success in 2006 and thus far this year , the pool of potential campaign donors is also less tilted toward the GOP today than it has been in the past . Pew Research Center surveys conducted over the past 13 years reveals a stark change in the party identification among the wealthiest voters – defined here as those in the top 10 % of household incomes . In 1995 , the year after the Republicans took control of the House and Senate , there were nearly twice as many Republicans ( 46 % ) as Democrats ( 25 % ) among the most affluent 10 % of registered voters ( household incomes of approximately $ 84,000 or more at the time ) . By comparison , there are just as many Democrats ( 31 % ) as Republicans ( 32 % ) among this class of voters today ( household incomes of approximately $ 135,000 or more ) . As has been the case nationwide , the shifting balance has had more to do with Republican losses than Democratic gains . Within the past two years , Republican Party identification has fallen nine percentage points among the wealthiest voters ( from 41 % to 32 % ) , while Democratic identification is up just three points . This mirrors the overall pattern nationwide , which shows a sizeable decline in GOP identification , and only modest growth in Democratic Party identification . ( For details , see March 22 , 2007 : Political Landscape More Favorable to Democrats . )
The five countries with the largest active-duty U.S. military presence in 2016 were Japan ( 38,818 ) , Germany ( 34,602 ) , South Korea ( 24,189 ) , Italy ( 12,088 ) and Afghanistan ( 9,023 ) . Of the top five countries , Afghanistan is the only one in open conflict , an issue that President Donald Trump addressed in a speech Monday .
In 2016 , as in recent years , Millennials and Gen Xers were the most Democratic generations . And both groups had relatively large – and growing – shares of liberal Democrats : 27 % of Millennials and 21 % of Gen Xers identified as liberal Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents . By contrast , Boomers and Silents were the most Republican groups – largely because of the higher shares of conservative Republicans in these generations . Nearly a third of Boomers ( 31 % ) and 36 % of Silents described themselves as conservative Republicans or Republican leaners , which also is higher than in the past . The differences in partisan identification across generations are most apparent in the shares of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans in each . All four groups have comparable numbers when it comes to groups in the middle : conservative and moderate Democrats and moderate and liberal Republicans .
A median of 69 % of adults across the 20 global publics favor expanding the use of natural gas , including about two-thirds or more in 16 of those places . The survey was conducted between October 2019 and March 2020 in the United States , Canada , Brazil , Russia and other places in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region .
The most common types of fireworks-related injuries this time last year were heat burns ( 38 % ) , followed by bruises and abrasions ( 19 % ) and cuts ( 15 % ) . And despite common stereotypes and decades of parental warnings , fewer than 4 % of fireworks-related injuries involved amputation of a body part .
The last time evaluations of the state of the nation were this negative was during the 2011 debt-ceiling showdown ; in July 2011 , before a last-minute agreement to raise the debt limit , just 17 % were satisfied , while 79 % were dissatisfied . The only time in recent history when public satisfaction has dipped below current levels was in October 2008 , during the depths of the financial crisis , when only 11 % said they were satisfied with the state of the nation .
When polled over the summer , in every European country surveyed , people who said the EU did well in its response to the pandemic were much more likely to have a positive view of the EU than those who thought the EU did a poor job dealing with COVID-19 . Perceptions of the economy at the time of the survey – as well as optimism about the economic future – also colored views of the bloc . Those who thought their domestic economy was in good shape and those who expected their country 's economy to improve were both more likely to have favorable views of the EU and to approve of its handling of COVID-19 than people who thought the economy was in bad shape or expected the economy to worsen .
Until recently , Facebook had dominated the social media landscape among America 's youth – but it is no longer the most popular online platform among teens , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . Today , roughly half ( 51 % ) of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 say they use Facebook , notably lower than the shares who use YouTube , Instagram or Snapchat .
The same survey found that a majority of Americans ( 65 % ) believe the Supreme Court has the right amount of power , rather than too much ( 25 % ) or too little ( 8 % ) . There were few partisan differences in these views .
Worries about a lengthy military commitment in the region also have risen over the past two weeks , and as many Americans now express a `` great deal '' of concern about this as have a high level of concern about the war leading to terrorism in the U.S. ( 42 % and 39 % , respectively ) . And a third of Americans say they worry a great deal that the conflict in Iraq could spark an all-out war in the Middle East .
Trump 's supporters raise different concerns : 17 % of those who approve of his job performance cite his use of Twitter and other social media , while 16 % say they are most concerned about obstruction from others , such as Congress and the news media . About one-in-ten of those who approve of Trump say their biggest concern is his personality ( 11 % ) and a similar share point to his policies ( 10 % ) .
Much of the disaffection with the EU among Europeans can be attributed to Brussels ' handling of the refugee issue . In every country surveyed , overwhelming majorities disapprove of how Brussels has dealt with the problem . This includes 94 % of Greeks , 88 % of Swedes and 77 % of Italians . The strongest approval of EU management of the refugee crisis is in the Netherlands , but that backing is a tepid 31 % . The EU 's handling of economic issues is another huge source of disaffection with the institution . About nine-in-ten Greeks ( 92 % ) disapprove of how the EU has dealt with the ongoing economic crisis . Roughly two-thirds of the Italians ( 68 % ) , French ( 66 % ) and Spanish ( 65 % ) similarly disapprove . ( France and Spain are the two nations where the favorability of the EU has recently experienced the largest decline . ) Majorities in Sweden ( 59 % ) and the UK ( 55 % ) , including 84 % of UKIP supporters , also disapprove of the EU 's job in dealing with economic challenges . The strongest approval of Brussels ' economic efforts is in Poland and Germany ( both 47 % ) .
About a third of 18- to 29-year-olds ( 35 % ) say the pandemic has been made a bigger deal than it really is , close to the overall average . But those youngest adults are more likely to say it has been made a smaller deal ( 32 % ) than any other age group . At the same time , fewer 18- to 29-year-olds say the outbreak has been approached about right ( 32 % ) than any other age group .
When it comes to meeting romantic partners , most teens do this offline . Only 8 % of teens say they have met a romantic partner online . For the small share of teen daters who have met a romantic partner over the internet , Facebook was cited more than any other social media site as a way that teens connect with potential partners .
Overall , 55 % of the public is very ( 30 % ) or somewhat ( 26 % ) confident in Mueller , while 37 % are not too confident ( 15 % ) or not at all confident ( 22 % ) he will conduct a fair investigation . These attitudes have changed little since December .
Immigrant adults are much more likely than natives to lack health insurance . More than half of unauthorized adults do not have insurance . A principal factor affecting this pattern is that the occupations and industries in which the unauthorized work tend to be those where employers do not provide insurance . Although poverty levels for children are higher than those of adults , children are more likely to have health insurance than adults . This pattern undoubtedly reflects the availability of coverage through the State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) in recent years . Children of immigrants are less likely to be covered by health insurance than children of natives , reflecting their higher levels of poverty and the lack of insurance on the part of their parents . Here again , the status of the child has a separate effect on coverage as U.S.-born children of immigrants are more likely to have insurance than children who are immigrants themselves . Legal immigrant children , while having high levels without insurance ( 25 % ) , are much more likely to be covered than unauthorized children ( 59 % ) . Here , the children are not eligible for SCHIP because of their status and their parents generally do not have coverage for themselves or their families .
Likewise , the percentage annual growth in construction employment measured on a quarterly basis was lower in the first quarter of 2007 than it had been in the three previous years ( Figure 8 ) . From the beginning of 2004 through the end of 2006 , the employment of foreign-born Latinos in the construction industry increased by an average of 17.4 % . In the first quarter of 2007 , it was up 10.9 % compared to the first quarter of 2006 . That is indicative of substantial ongoing growth of employment for immigrant Latinos in the construction industry but at a somewhat slower rate than in the previous three years .
About half of the public ( 46 % ) says the U.S. Supreme Court should make its rulings based on its understanding of what the Constitution `` meant as it was originally written , '' while an identical share says the court should base its rulings on what the Constitution `` means in current times , '' according to a survey conducted in October . Public opinion about this issue has changed little in recent years . By about two-to-one ( 63 % to 31 % ) , adults younger than 30 say the court should base its rulings on its understanding of the Constitution 's current meaning , rather than what it meant when originally written . Views among those ages 30 to 49 are more divided ( 44 % original meaning , 45 % meaning in current times ) . A 54 % majority of those 50 and older say rulings should be based on the court 's understanding of the Constitution 's original meaning . Blacks ( 63 % ) are more likely than whites ( 41 % ) to say the court should base its rulings on its understanding of the Constitution 's current meaning . And adults with at least a college degree , particularly those with postgraduate degrees , are more likely than those with less education to express this view .
And as is also true of the accounts they follow , a small subset of these accounts were mentioned at least once during this time period by a notable share of all U.S. adults on Twitter . Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) was mentioned by 12 % of U.S. adults on that platform during that period – and by comparable shares of Democrats ( 13 % ) and Republicans ( 12 % ) . Biden ( @ JoeBiden ) and the video-sharing site YouTube ( @ YouTube ) also rank among the three most mentioned accounts during this period for Democrats and Republicans alike .
The number of active-duty U.S. military troops stationed overseas has dipped below 200,000 for the first time in at least 60 years . The decline , reflecting a broader one in active-duty U.S. forces , has occurred in multiple countries – including South Korea , which has become a focus of attention amid escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea .
Among self-identified Hispanics , 61 % of immigrants are Spanish dominant , meaning they are more proficient in speaking and reading in Spanish than they are in English . By comparison , only 6 % of the second generation is Spanish dominant and essentially none of the third generation is Spanish dominant , according to the Center 's estimates . While a small share of U.S.-born Latinos are Spanish dominant , a larger share is bilingual . Among second-generation self-identified Latinos – i.e. , the U.S.-born children of immigrant parents – about half ( 51 % ) are bilingual . Among third or higher generation self-identified Latinos , that share is 24 % .
But , judging by the results of our recently released survey on religion in everyday life , religion does indeed seem to be a subject many people avoid . About half of U.S. adults tell us they seldom ( 33 % ) or never ( 16 % ) talk about religion with people outside their family . And roughly four-in-ten say they seldom ( 26 % ) or never ( 13 % ) discuss religion even with members of their immediate family .
Asked whether or not the growing world population will be a major problem , 59 % of Americans agreed it will strain the planet 's natural resources , while 82 % of U.S.-based members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science said the same . Just 17 % of AAAS scientists and 38 % of Americans said population growth wo n't be a problem because we will find a way to stretch natural resources .
Private companies such as SpaceX , Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic continue to develop space exploration capabilities that were once the sole purview of government agencies such as NASA . Some 44 % of Americans have a great deal of confidence these companies will make a profit in their space-related ventures , with 36 % saying they are fairly confident that space companies will be profitable .
Once online , internet users in emerging and developing nations have embraced socializing as their most preferred type of digital activity . Majorities of internet users in all countries surveyed with large enough sample sizes to analyze say they stay in touch with friends and family online . Many also use cyberspace for getting information about politics , health care and government services . Less common are commercial and career activities , such as searching or applying for a job , making or receiving payments , buying products and taking online classes .
The public appears ready for a truce in the long-running war on drugs . A national survey by the Pew Research Center finds that 67 % of Americans say that the government should focus more on providing treatment for those who use illegal drugs such as heroin and cocaine . Just 26 % think the government 's focus should be on prosecuting users of such hard drugs .
Mexico and Canada have lost confidence in the U.S. president . In the United States ' southern and northern neighbors , confidence has fluctuated over the past three presidencies but declined most sharply this year . Just 22 % of Canadians and 5 % of Mexicans have at least some confidence in the U.S. president , down from more than eight-in-ten Canadians ( 83 % ) in 2016 and half of Mexicans ( 49 % ) in 2015 . While Canadians generally have indicated greater confidence in U.S. presidents than Mexicans have , current Trump confidence levels are lower than both countries ' Bush-era lows . Current Trump confidence ratings in these countries are similar to their respective lows during the George W. Bush years . For example , only 13 % of French respondents had at least some confidence in Bush in 2008 , and now 14 % in France say the same for Trump . Likewise , 14 % of Germans had at least some confidence in Bush in 2008 , while 11 % are confident in Trump now .
Combined annual profit for Fox News , MSNBC and CNN was projected to grow 4 % in 2018 , to $ 2.8 billion .
Those who consistently stayed with their parties expressed strong views of Trump , both positive and negative . In April 2017 , 84 % of those who consistently identified with or leaned toward the Republican Party approved of Trump 's job performance – with 66 % approving strongly .
On balance , people across the former Soviet bloc nations approve of the changeover to a multiparty electoral system and free market economy . Majorities in Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Hungary , Lithuania and the area corresponding to former East Germany all rate these transitions favorably .
The Japanese are not nearly as positive about China , their most powerful Asian neighbor . Roughly one-in-ten ( 11 % ) hold a favorable view of China , while 86 % express an unfavorable opinion , including 42 % who are very unfavorable . This was not always the case : In 2002 , 55 % of Japanese had a positive view of China .
After stabilizing briefly , response rates to telephone public opinion polls conducted by Pew Research Center have resumed their decline . In 2017 and 2018 , typical telephone survey response rates fell to 7 % and 6 % , respectively , according to the Center 's latest data . Response rates had previously held steady around 9 % for several years .
Federal law enforcement agencies are making more arrests for immigration-related offenses and fewer arrests for other types of offenses – including drug , property and gun crimes – than they were a decade ago , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics . Half ( 50 % ) of the 165,265 total arrests made by the federal government in fiscal 2014 – the most recent year for which statistics are available – were for immigration-related offenses , such as crossing the border illegally or smuggling others into the United States . A decade earlier , immigration-related offenses accounted for 28 % of all federal arrests . At the same time , arrests for drug crimes fell from 23 % of the total in 2004 to 14 % in 2014 . Those for supervision violations , such as probation or parole infractions , fell from 17 % to 14 % . Arrests for property crimes , including fraud and embezzlement , declined from 11 % to 8 % . And arrests for weapon offenses , such as possession of an unregistered firearm , fell from 7 % to 4 % .
Trzaskowski formerly served as a member of European Parliament and advocates greater integration with the EU . More than eight-in-ten Poles ( 84 % ) have a favorable view of the EU , the highest share among countries in the region . Additionally , about two-thirds ( 67 % ) think membership in the union is a good thing for Poland . Views of the EU and its value for Poles have grown more positive in recent years . Between 2018 and 2019 , the share of Polish adults with a favorable view of the EU rose 12 points , from 72 % to 84 % . Poles have also become more likely to see EU membership positively : The share who say that membership in the EU has been a good thing for Poland rose from 48 % in 2012 to 67 % in 2019 .
This pattern also is seen in views of the parties ' efforts in addressing concerns of several other groups : Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say their party does too little to address the concerns of blacks ( 50 % of Democrats vs. 32 % of Republicans ) , Hispanics ( 43 % vs. 29 % ) and men ( 26 % vs. 16 % ) . And while 64 % of Democrats say their party does too little to address the concerns of people in rural areas , a smaller share of Republicans ( 45 % ) say this about the GOP .
Our analysis of Federal Reserve data does reveal a stark divide in the experiences of white , black and Hispanic households during the economic recovery . From 2010 to 2013 , the median wealth of non-Hispanic white households increased from $ 138,600 to $ 141,900 , or by 2.4 % .
The Chinese public stands out from others surveyed in saying they prefer teaching both sets of skills . More than a quarter of Chinese volunteer that schools should emphasize both creative thinking and basic skills and discipline . This may be due in part to their educational system 's reliance on standardized testing ( the gaokao ) . While rote memorization and discipline are seen as keys for success on this future-defining exam , there is much handwringing domestically about how gaokao preparation comes at the expense of more creative opportunities . Younger , wealthier and better educated Chinese are particularly likely to prioritize imagination and creativity in the classroom .
The public 's interest in economic news remains moderate and has not grown in recent months . Roughly a quarter of the public ( 27 % ) paid very close attention to economic news last week and 16 % listed this as the story they followed most closely .
While new technology allows campaigns and groups multiple ways to reach out to voters , campaign commercials have by far the widest reach . Fully 72 % of registered voters nationwide report having seen or heard campaign commercials related to the 2012 presidential campaign . That is far more than the percentages saying they have received email from a campaign or political group ( 16 % ) , visited a candidate 's website ( 15 % ) or followed a candidate 's updates on Twitter or Facebook ( 6 % ) .
Both younger and older veterans gave higher approval ratings for Trump than did younger and older adults overall . Nearly half of veterans ages 18 to 49 ( 46 % ) approved of Trump 's job performance , compared with only 31 % of all adults younger than 50 . Among those 50 and older , nearly six-in-ten veterans ( 58 % ) supported Trump , while about half of all older adults ( 49 % ) said the same .
Views among Hispanics born in the U.S. mirror those of all Americans—about six-in-ten believe that kids are better off if a parent stays home to focus on the family , according to a 2014 Pew Research Center survey . But a far larger majority—85 % –of foreign-born Hispanics say that children are better off if a parent is at home .
Americans with a bachelor 's or postgraduate degree ( both 81 % ) are more likely than adults who attended some college ( 73 % ) or who have a high school diploma or less ( 63 % ) to have positive overall opinions of medical doctors . A similar education pattern exists for opinions of medical researchers . White adults ( 75 % ) are more likely than black adults ( 61 % ) to have a positive view of medical doctors . Black Americans also stand out for their lower ratings of medical research scientists : About half ( 53 % ) have a positive view , compared with majorities of white ( 68 % ) and Hispanic ( 67 % ) adults .
Science knowledge is closely related to expectations for harm from climate change among Democrats , but not among Republicans . In 2016 , Democrats with high science knowledge were far more likely than Democrats with low science knowledge to say a series of environmental impacts would be very likely to occur as a result of climate change , including rising sea levels and intensifying storms . But there are only modest or no differences among Republicans with different levels of science knowledge in their expectations of harm to the Earth 's ecosystems .
Yet the survey also shows that immigration is not a deal breaker issue for many Latino voters . Some 54 % say they would vote for a candidate who disagrees with them on immigration policy if that candidate agrees with them on most other issues . Nonetheless , about one-third ( 36 % ) say they would not vote for a candidate if they disagreed with the candidate on immigration policy .
Overall , the American public is closely divided between those expressing favorable and unfavorable views of China . But there are notable differences along partisan lines , with Democrats significantly more likely than Republicans or independents to offer a positive opinion of China . However , despite a 2016 presidential campaign season that featured a fair amount of negative rhetoric about China from then-candidate Trump and other GOP contenders , ratings have actually become more positive among Republicans . A year ago , 27 % had a favorable opinion , compared with 39 % today . Democrats also express more positive ratings this year ( 49 % favorable vs. 39 % in 2016 ) . Views among independents are essentially unchanged ( 41 % favorable vs. 40 % last year ) .
As in past Pew Research Center surveys of library use , the April 2016 survey also measured Americans ' usage of and engagement with libraries . Overall , 53 % of Americans age 16 or older have had some interaction with a public library in the past year – either through an in-person visit , using a library website , or via a mobile app . Some 48 % of adults specifically visited a library or bookmobile in the past 12 months , a modest uptick from the 44 % who said that in late 2015 . There was a four-point drop , though , in the number who visited library websites in the previous 12 months – falling from 31 % who said they 'd done so in 2015 to 27 % in 2016 .
While Trump has yet to release his personal tax returns , the public thinks that he has a responsibility to do so : 60 % say this , compared with 33 % who say he does not have a responsibility to release his tax returns . By 79 % to 17 % , more Democrats and Democratic leaners say Trump has a responsibility to release his tax returns than say he does not . Among Republicans and Republican leaners , 38 % say he has a responsibility to do this , compared with 53 % who say he does not have this responsibility .
As public sentiment about the economy changes , Japanese attitudes about the country 's strategic role in the world are evolving . For some time , there has been a robust public debate within Japan about whether Tokyo needs a military capacity and a willingness to engage in security operations commensurate with the country 's stature as the world 's third largest economy . But such ambitions have long been constrained by Japan 's post-World War II constitution . A majority of Japanese ( 56 % ) oppose changing their constitution so that Japan could officially have a military and declare war . But that opposition has declined by 11 percentage points since 2006 , when 67 % were against constitutional revision . Men ( 45 % ) are much more willing to support constitutional revision than are women ( 28 % ) .
Fully two-thirds ( 67 % ) of Latinos say they expect their financial situation to improve over the next year , compared with 58 % of the general population who say the same . Also , two-thirds ( 66 % ) of Latinos say they expect their children to eventually enjoy a standard of living that is better than theirs is now . By contrast , just 48 % of the general public says the same .
Most Americans say it does n't matter if their co-workers are men or women . But for those with a preference , men say they would rather work with men—and so do women , according to a recent Pew Research Center survey .
Most national publics around the world – a global median of 69 % – are dissatisfied with the way things are going in their country . By this broad measure of national unease , which may encompass public perception of economic , political , social and security conditions , half or more of the publics in 36 of the 44 nations surveyed say conditions in their society are not good .
Asked about the impact of these learning activities , many personal and professional learners cite a variety of benefits . For the 74 % of the population who pursued personal learning in the past 12 months , the rewards often tie to psychological and social benefits :
Some states are expanding access to voting by mail amid ongoing fears over the coronavirus outbreak . But while the share of Americans casting votes by mail has risen in recent presidential election cycles , it remains relatively low overall , and there 's wide variation across the country when it comes to the percentage of voters who have used this method . Overall , the share of voters who cast ballots via mail-in methods increased nearly threefold between 1996 and 2016 – from 7.8 % to nearly 21 % , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Census Bureau 's voter supplement data .
Among individual cable news outlets , CNN 's regular audience has declined since 2008 . Four years ago , nearly a quarter of Americans ( 24 % ) said they regularly watched CNN ; that has fallen to 16 % in the new survey . Regular viewership for both Fox News and MSNBC has not changed much in recent years . About one-in-five Americans ( 21 % ) say they regularly watch Fox News , while about half as many ( 11 % ) say they regularly watch MSNBC .
More than twice as many Republicans view Netanyahu favorably ( 53 % ) as unfavorably ( 21 % ) ; 26 % have no opinion . By contrast , Democrats hold mixed views of Netanyahu ( 28 % favorable vs. 35 % unfavorable ) ; 37 % have no opinion . Independents ' opinions of Netanyahu mirror those of the overall public ( 38 % favorable , 26 % unfavorable , 36 % no opinion ) .
Nearly as many ( 78 % ) correctly identify John F. Kennedy as a Democrat . But Americans are less familiar with the partisan affiliations of earlier presidents and current congressional leaders . Roughly six-in-ten ( 58 % ) know that Franklin Roosevelt was a Democrat , while 55 % correctly identify Abraham Lincoln as a Republican . Comparable majorities know that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat ( 61 % ) and House Speaker John Boehner is a Republican ( 55 % ) .
Democratic voters want the next president to continue Obama 's policies . In our most recent survey , 61 % of possible Democratic primary voters said they would be more likely to vote for a presidential candidate who offers programs similar to the Obama administration , and 60 % said they would be more likely to back a candidate who will compromise with Republicans . Smaller percentages expressed positive views about a candidate who wants to cut the size of big banks ( 48 % ) , expand trade agreements ( 45 % ) or back the nuclear agreement with Iran ( 41 % ) .
Favorable ratings for the federal government in Washington have taken the hardest hit , falling from 59 % last year to 45 % currently . The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , conducted among 2,006 Americans from Oct. 12 - 24 , finds that even positive views of the military , while very high , have slipped slightly ( from 87 % in March to 82 % ) . Just two institutions are unscathed by public discontent . Ratings for the Supreme Court and the news media were unchanged compared to previous surveys .
A third ( 33 % ) of the public says they followed the debate over health care reform more closely than other top stories last week , while 22 % followed reports about the condition of the U.S. economy most closely . According to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey , conducted October 2 - 5 by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press , one-in-ten followed news about earthquakes in Indonesia and a tsunami in the South Pacific most closely , while 9 % named talks between the United States and Iran over Iran 's nuclear program as their top story .
Though a majority of people in Pakistan are still unhappy with the country 's direction , satisfaction is on the rise . A quarter of Pakistanis are satisfied with the way things are going in their country , an increase of 17 percentage points from 2013 when just 8 % held this view . Pakistanis are more satisfied with the direction of their country than they have been in six years . Men are slightly more likely to express satisfaction ( 29 % ) than women ( 20 % ) .
Meanwhile , most Clinton supporters not only take a dim view of Trump , but say they have a hard time respecting the people who support the Republican nominee . Nearly six-in-ten Clinton supporters ( 58 % ) say they `` have a hard time respecting someone who supports Donald Trump for president . '' Just 40 % say they have `` no trouble '' respecting someone who backs Trump . Trump supporters are less likely to say they have difficulty respecting Clinton voters . Four-in-ten ( 40 % ) say they have a hard time respecting Clinton voters , while 56 % say they have no trouble doing so .
Publics around the world overwhelmingly agree that the news media should be unbiased in their coverage of political issues , according to a new Pew Research Center survey of 38 countries . Yet , when asked how their news media are doing on reporting different political issues fairly , people are far more mixed in their sentiments , with many saying their media do not deliver . And , in many countries , there are sharp political differences in views of the media – with the largest gap among Americans .
Muslims are the fastest-growing major religious group , largely because they have the highest fertility rate and the youngest population . As a result , the Muslim population is expected to increase from 1.6 billion people ( 23 % of the world 's population as of 2010 ) to 2.76 billion people ( 30 % of all people in 2050 ) . At mid-century , Muslims will nearly equal Christians – the world 's largest religious group – in size .
Before talk about a `` triple dip recession '' made headlines , Europeans have been overwhelmed with economic concerns and the growing gap between the rich and the poor is high on that list . Overall , a median of 32 % across the seven EU nations surveyed name inequality as the top threat to the world . People in Spain and Greece , among the hardest hit by the Eurocrisis , are especially worried . In fact , worries about inequality have doubled in Spain since 2007 , as well as in Italy , another economically damaged southern European country . While the British are also concerned about inequality , fears about religious and ethnic hatred are even more common in the United Kingdom ( 39 % name it top threat ) .
The gender gap in 2008 – the seven-point difference between women and men in support for the Democratic candidate – was comparable to the gap in most elections since 1980 . Even when Democratic candidates failed to garner a majority of the women 's vote – as in 1980 , 1984 and 1988 – they still drew more support from women than from men . The election of 1992 was unusual because of Ross Perot 's popular third-party campaign . Still , the gender gap was significant : Women backed Bill Clinton over George H.W . Bush , 45 % to 37 % , with 17 % supporting Perot . Clinton had a narrower lead among men ( 41 % Clinton , 38 % Bush ) ; 21 % of men voted for Perot , according to exit polls conducted after the 1992 election .
The annual inflow of unauthorized immigrants to the United States was nearly two-thirds smaller in the March 2007 to March 2009 period than it had been from March 2000 to March 2005 , according to new estimates by the Pew Hispanic Center , a project of the Pew Research Center .
Germans are more positive about globalization than Americans , but there are divisions within each country . When asked whether globalization in the past few years has been a good thing or bad thing for their country , Americans are about evenly divided ( 47 % vs. 44 % ) . By comparison , nearly six-in-ten Germans ( 59 % ) see globalization as advantageous to their country , while only three-in-ten say it has been a bad thing . ( The surveys did not define globalization . )
Americans and Germans have different views toward tariffs . In June 2018 , the Trump administration 's tariffs on European steel and aluminum went into effect . In response , Germany and its European Union allies placed tariffs on American goods , ranging from bourbon to motorcycles . In the U.S. , more Americans oppose than support the initial tariffs imposed on German and other EU products ( 51 % vs. 44 % ) . Germans , however , support retaliatory tariffs by a large margin : Nearly eight-in-ten ( 78 % ) support increasing tariffs on imported U.S. products in response to American tariffs on German goods .
With President Donald Trump 's labor secretary nominee set to appear before the Senate next week , the public has broadly positive views of both labor unions and business corporations . About six-in-ten adults today have a favorable view of labor unions ( 60 % ) and business corporations ( 56 % ) , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . Views of both have grown more positive since March 2015 , when roughly half of adults ( 48 % ) expressed a favorable view of each .
Between paid and unpaid work , the average mother works about 2 more hours a week than she did in 1965 , though the mix of time spent on paid work , housework and child care has changed dramatically :
Europe was gripped by rising popular discontent with the European Union and concerns about refugees . While the United Kingdom 's vote to leave the EU – known as `` Brexit '' – was one of the most dramatic reflections of the mood in Europe , a spring survey found a median of just 51 % across 10 EU countries had a favorable view of the institution and a median of 42 % wanted more power returned to their nations ' capitals . Unhappiness with the EU coincided with the influx of refugees , mostly from the Middle East , stoking concerns about security and economic repercussions . In eight of the 10 European nations surveyed , half or more said incoming refugees would increase the likelihood of terrorism in their country . As immigrant populations increased , few Europeans said the resulting cultural diversity made their countries a better place to live .
Nearly 1 in 100 worldwide are now displaced from their homes . As of the end of 2015 , the number of displaced people in the world – more than 60 million – is at its highest since World War II . Conflict in Syria has been the principal contributor to the recent growth in the world 's displaced population .
Americans see fundamental differences between men and women , but men and women have different views on the cause of these differences . Majorities of women who see gender differences in the way people express their feelings , excel at work and approach parenting say differences between men and women are mostly based on societal expectations . Men who see differences in these areas tend to believe biology is the root .
Tax expenditures are defined as departures from `` normal '' income-tax law that benefit particular individuals and businesses . They include everything from the favorable tax treatment of employer-paid health insurance ( estimated to cost the government a total of $ 769.8 billion over five years ) to a tax credit for economic development in American Samoa ( estimated five-year cost : less than $ 50 million ) . The biggest individual tax break was for employer-paid health care , health insurance and long-term care insurance , none of which is counted as taxable income . That provision cost the government an estimated $ 145.5 billion last fiscal year , and is estimated to cost $ 143.8 billion this year . Taxing dividends and capital gains at lower rates than ordinary income will keep an estimated $ 134.6 billion out of the Treasury in the current fiscal year . The controversial mortgage-interest deduction will cost $ 77 billion this fiscal year , while the accompanying deduction for local property tax payments will cost another $ 34.7 billion .
Americans today also are less likely to oppose a close relative marrying someone of a different race or ethnicity . Now , 10 % say they would oppose such a marriage in their family , down from 31 % in 2000 . The biggest decline has occurred among nonblacks : Today , 14 % of nonblacks say they would oppose a close relative marrying a black person , down from 63 % in 1990 .
When both parents in a household work full time , most say neither 's career takes priority , but half say dad makes more money . Some 62 % say the mother and father are equally focused on their careers , while 22 % say the father is more career-oriented and 15 % say it 's the mother .
Three-quarters of Americans are concerned about the environment , but fewer say they make an effort to live out that concern all the time . Among U.S. adults , 75 % say they are particularly concerned about helping the environment as they go about their daily lives , according to a 2016 Pew Research Center survey . But only one-in-five Americans say they make an effort to live in ways that help protect the environment `` all the time . '' Those ages 65 and older are three times as likely as those ages 18 to 29 to say they make this effort all the time ( 36 % vs. 12 % ) . Overall , 32 % of U.S. adults say they are bothered a lot by people throwing away things that could be recycled . Roughly six-in-ten Americans ( 61 % ) who say they always try to live in ways that protect the environment say it bothers them `` a lot '' when others throw away things that could be recycled . Among those who are less focused on environmental protection , only a quarter say it bothers them a lot when others do n't recycle . People who are environmentally conscious are also twice as likely as others to say that seeing someone incorrectly putting trash in recycling bins bothers them a lot ( 42 % vs. 21 % ) .
Total newsroom spending by the three channels combined increased by 5 % in 2018 to a total of $ 2.4 billion , according to estimates by Kagan . Newsroom spending at the three major financial networks was $ 725 million , a 3 % change .
American views of China are not extreme in a global perspective . A 2010 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey found roughly half of Americans expressing a favorable opinion of China , while 36 % said they felt unfavorably . In that survey , attitudes toward China were far more negative in France , Germany and Turkey , as well as among the publics of some of China 's neighbors , such as Japan , South Korea and India . By contrast , China is viewed in an overwhelmingly favorable light in places like Kenya and Nigeria ( where the U.S. is also viewed very favorably ) as well as in Pakistan ( where opinions of the U.S. are mostly negative ) .
About six-in-ten ( 61 % ) say that `` some people taking advantage of the situation to engage in criminal behavior '' contributed a `` great deal '' to the unrest , while 56 % say the same about tensions between the African-American community and the police . However , majorities say all five factors mentioned in the survey – including anger over the death of Freddie Gray , poverty in some neighborhoods and the initial response by city officials – contributed at least a fair amount to the unrest .
Improved views among Republicans help lift economic ratings . The public 's views of the nation 's economy – both current and future conditions – continue to be relatively positive . Currently , 42 % rate economic conditions as excellent or good , up 11 percentage points since December . The share of Republicans who take a positive view of economic conditions has nearly tripled since then , from 14 % to 40 % , while holding more stable among Democrats . As in December , Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to expect economic conditions to improve ( 75 % vs. 14 % ) .
A majority ( 62 % ) of Republicans and Republican leaners in counties that went very strongly for Donald Trump in the general election ( those where his share of the two-party vote was at least 40 percentage points greater than Hillary Clinton 's ) said that when these disagreements happened , it was better to try to find common ground . In counties that Trump won less resoundingly , or those where Clinton prevailed , Republicans were less likely to seek common ground on politics and more likely to prefer to avoid talking about differences , according to the national survey conducted Nov. 29-Dec. 12 among 4,138 adults on Pew Research Center 's American Trends Panel . A similar pattern was evident among Democrats and Democratic leaners : 59 % of those living in counties where Clinton defeated Trump by 40 points or more said it was better to address political differences , while 40 % it was better to avoid talking about these differences . Among Democrats in strong Trump counties , opinion was almost the reverse : 61 % said it was better to avoid raising political differences while just 39 % said it was better to talk about them . The post-election survey found only modest partisan differences in how often people talked about Trump 's plans and policies in conversations in the weeks after the election . But the geographic pattern was different for Republicans than for Democrats in counties where one side or the other dominated . In counties that went strongly for Trump , 30 % of Republicans and just 14 % of Democrats said the president-elect 's plans came up `` a lot '' in conversation . Partisan differences were more modest in other counties . And in those counties where Clinton won decisively , 31 % of Democrats and a similar share of Republicans ( 28 % ) said this topic came up a lot .
But Republican Party gains among Hispanic registered voters in terms of party identification do not extend to Hispanic voters ' views of the party . Just 10 % say the Republican Party has more concern than the Democratic Party for the Hispanic community , unchanged since 2012 . Instead , the share of Hispanic registered voters who say there is no difference between the two parties is up , to 35 % today from 23 % in 2012 .
In other news last week , a third of Americans ( 32 % ) paid very close attention to news about plans for the new Obama administration , and another 37 % followed this story fairly closely . One-in-five ( 19 % ) listed this as their most closely followed story of the week . Democrats were much more interested than Republicans in news about the Obama transition ( 48 % of Democrats vs. 19 % of Republicans followed very closely ) . In other political news , 16 % of the public followed stories about Sarah Palin very closely . The Alaska governor granted a host of television interviews last week , and by week 's end she had become the focus of 4 % of the overall national newshole . Republicans followed news about Palin much more closely than did Democrats ( 27 % vs. 14 % followed very closely ) . One-in-five Americans ( 21 % ) followed the wildfires in Southern California very closely last week and another 28 % paid fairly close attention . Coverage of the fires accounted for 3 % of the national newshole , according the Pew 's Project for Excellence in Journalism . Public interest in last week 's fires was nowhere near as high as last year 's devastating fires in that region . In late October , 2007 40 % of the public was following the California wildfires very closely .
Germans see France as their country 's top foreign policy partner , while Americans name the United Kingdom . Germans and Americans do not view the other country as their own nation 's principal foreign policy partner . More than four-in-ten Germans ( 44 % ) name France as the most important foreign policy partner for their country ; 10 % of Germans name the U.S . Meanwhile , roughly a quarter of Americans ( 26 % ) cite the UK as their country 's most important partner , while Germany is a distant fourth , cited by 6 % of U.S. adults , similar to the share ( 4 % ) expressed in 2019 . Last year , around two-in-ten Germans ( 19 % ) saw the U.S. as their country 's top partner .
Half or more of Americans have positive views about each of six professional groups asked about in the survey . The public is warmest toward medical doctors : About three-quarters ( 74 % ) say they have a mostly positive view of doctors , 18 % are neutral and just 8 % have a negative view . Majorities also have positive opinions of medical researchers ( 68 % ) , dietitians ( 60 % ) , environmental health specialists ( 60 % ) and environmental researchers ( 57 % ) . About half ( 51 % ) have positive overall views of nutrition researchers . Majorities trust medical doctors and dietitians to care about their patients ' best interests , but trust in other scientists is lower . Respondents were asked whether scientists in each of the six specialties could be trusted to act with competence , to present their recommendations or research findings accurately , and to care about people 's best interests . Americans tend to trust practitioners in medicine and nutrition – who directly interact with patients – more than researchers in these areas . For example , a majority of Americans ( 57 % ) say medical doctors care about patients ' best interests all or most of the time , while far fewer ( 35 % ) say medical researchers always or usually care about the public 's interests . And 60 % say dietitians care about their patients ' best interests all of most of the time , compared with 29 % who say nutrition research scientists care about the public interest with the same frequency . But trust in environmental health specialists – practitioners who offer recommendations to organizations and community groups – is about the same as that for environmental researchers . Most turn a skeptical eye to issues of scientific integrity . Minorities of Americans believe scientists are transparent about potential conflicts of interest with industry all or most of the time . Shares saying this range from 12 % to 19 % , depending on the specific type of work being asked about . Similarly , few Americans ( from 11 % to 18 % ) think scientists admit and take responsibility for their mistakes all or most of the time . And small shares see repercussions for misconduct as commonplace : No more than two-in-ten U.S. adults say scientists in each field of work face serious consequences for misconduct all or most of the time .
Currently about four-in-ten ( 42 % ) Republicans and Republican leaning registered voters say they agree with the Tea Party movement . This is little changed over the course of the last year , but down from the height of the movement in 2010 , when a majority of Republican voters identified with the Tea Party .
While Muslims are still a relatively small share of Europe 's population ( roughly 5 % ) , they are set to continue rising as a percentage of Europe 's population , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of demographic data . This is true even if immigration stops entirely in the coming decades , which is a highly unlikely scenario . And if migration to the continent continues at medium or high levels , the share of Europe 's population that is Muslim could more than double between now and 2050 , according to the analysis , which defines Europe as the 28 European Union member states plus Norway and Switzerland .
Employment is rising more rapidly in jobs in which social and fundamental skills are most important . From 1980 to 2018 , overall employment more than doubled in jobs where social and fundamental skills are most important , by 111 % and 104 % , respectively . ( Examples of such jobs are social workers , lawyers and obstetricians . ) Employment in jobs most in need of analytical skills , such as computer programmers , increased nearly as sharply ( 92 % ) , compared with an increase of 58 % in employment overall . Meanwhile , there was virtually no change in employment in jobs relying most on mechanical skills ( only 4 % ) . That is at least in part due to globalization and technological change , which have sharply reduced job opportunities in the manufacturing sector and the need for mechanical skills .
25 % of those who are aware of the surveillance programs ( 22 % of all adults ) say they have changed the patterns of their own use of various technological platforms `` a great deal '' or `` somewhat '' since the Snowden revelations . For instance , 18 % say they have changed the way they use email `` a great deal '' or `` somewhat '' ; 17 % have changed the way they use search engines ; 15 % say they have changed the way they use social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook ; and 15 % have changed the way they use their cell phones .
The survey finds that as debate over legal immigration also heats up , the public is split on the best approach for the country . Slightly more say legal immigration into the United States should be decreased ( 31 % ) than increased ( 24 % ) , while a 39 % plurality says legal immigration should be kept at its present level .
Another Pew Global Attitudes Project survey conducted earlier this year in France , Germany , Great Britain , and Spain finds that a majority of Muslim women in Great Britain and Spain and just under half of Muslim women in Germany cover their heads every day or almost every day . In Great Britain , where the debate over head scarves and veils has become particularly heated following former foreign secretary Jack Straw 's recent comments that the full-face veil is `` a visible statement of separation and of difference , '' more than half of Muslim women report wearing the head scarf every day . Slightly more than four-in-ten Muslim women in Spain and Germany cover their heads daily , while an additional two-in-ten in Spain and nearly one-in-six in Germany do so at least occasionally . About a third of Muslim women in Spain and 41 % in Germany never cover their heads . Only in France do a large majority of Muslim women ( 73 % ) say they `` never '' wear the religiously prescribed head covering . This reflects other survey results that show French Muslims generally are less likely to identify primarily as Muslims than are their counterparts in other European countries .3 Still , one-in-eight say they follow the dictates of their faith and cover their heads every day .
Across a range of measures , Republicans are far more negative than Democrats in their assessments of the news media . In a February survey , more than half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said news organizations do n't care about the people they report on ( 69 % ) , are not professional ( 60 % ) , are too critical of America ( 58 % ) , hurt democracy ( 56 % ) and do n't care about how good of a job they do ( 54 % ) . Democrats and Democratic leaners were far more positive than Republicans on all of these questions . The partisan divide in views of the news media extends to views of specific outlets , too , as a separate Center study found in January .
These developments come at a time when many United Methodists in the United States have a more accepting view toward homosexuality . In Pew Research Center 's 2014 U.S . Religious Landscape Study , 60 % of United Methodists said homosexuality should be accepted by society – a clear majority , and a substantial increase from 2007 , when 51 % said this . In addition , about half of U.S. Methodists ( 49 % ) said they favored legal same-sex marriage .
Democrats and Democratic leaners are 9 points more likely than last summer to say they are `` not at all '' confident in Trump to make wise decisions about the use of military force ( 68 % today , compared with 59 % last August ) . However , the combined share who say they are not too or not at all confident in Trump on this measure is about the same as it was last summer .
When it comes to workplace automation that has already occurred , Americans are more likely to say it has hurt U.S. workers than helped them . Around half of U.S. adults ( 48 % ) say job automation through new technology in the workplace has mostly hurt American workers , while just 22 % say it has generally helped , according to the 2018 survey . About three-in-ten ( 28 % ) say these advances have neither helped nor hurt U.S. workers .
Majorities in both parties view the other party as closer to the ideological extreme than the center . Nearly six-in-ten Democrats ( 58 % ) place the Republican Party at one of the three most conservative points on the scale ( 0 - 2 ) , while 69 % of Republicans place the Democratic Party on the most liberal points ( 8 - 10 ) . Among Republicans , 71 % place themselves at least one point away from where they place the GOP on an ideological scale of zero to 10 . They are more likely to consider themselves to the right of the party than its left . More than four-in-ten Republicans ( 44 % ) identify as more conservative than their party , with 19 % putting themselves at least three points to the right . Fewer Republicans ( 28 % ) rate themselves as more liberal than the GOP .
Overall , 32 % of cell owners used their mobile devices in the 30 days preceding our survey for one or more of these reasons , and cell owners under the age of 25 have high levels of engagement in each of these activities . At the same time , using one 's cell phone to visit a website mentioned during televised programming is relatively common with older cell owners as well—engagement in this behavior does not drop significantly until approximately age 45 .
As U.S. President Donald Trump prepares for a state visit to India , the two nations ' economic relationship will take center stage after several months of back-and-forth about escalating tariffs . And while Trump himself receives positive marks from the Indian populace , some of his specific policies and trade attitudes in general do not garner the same warm reception . A majority of Indians have confidence in Donald Trump to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs . Trump 's image in India has gained favor since his candidacy in 2016 , jumping from 14 % confidence to 56 % over three years . Much of this movement is accompanied by more people now offering an opinion about the U.S. president . The share volunteering a response of `` do n't know '' or declining to answer has fallen precipitously over the same period , from 67 % in 2016 to just 30 % in 2019 . Meanwhile , the small share of those saying they lack confidence in Trump when it comes to foreign policy has remained stable . These latest numbers resemble those of Trump 's predecessor : Before Barack Obama left office , 58 % of Indians had confidence in him in world affairs , while 9 % had no confidence and 33 % did not offer an opinion .
A majority of Americans ( 55 % ) now say the U.S. Supreme Court should base its rulings on what the Constitution `` means in current times , '' while 41 % say rulings should be based on what it `` meant as originally written , '' according to a recent Pew Research Center report on American democratic values . This represents a shift in public opinion , which was divided on this question for more than a decade . When Pew Research Center last asked the question in October 2016 , 46 % said the high court should base its rulings on what the document means in current times , while an identical share ( 46 % ) said rulings should be based on what it meant when originally written . Nearly eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents ( 78 % ) now say rulings should be based on the Constitution 's meaning in current times , higher than at any previous point on record and up 9 percentage points from 2016 ( 69 % ) . Just three-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners now say the same , an 11-point increase from 2016 but little changed from GOP views in the years prior .
In most cases , Black , Hispanic and Asian American users stand out from White users in how effective they think social media are at achieving some social and political aims . About seven-in-ten Black , Hispanic and Asian users say social media are at least somewhat effective for changing people 's minds about political or social issues , compared with half of White users who say the same . These views generally hold true when influencing policy decisions and getting elected officials to pay attention to issues are considered . As to whether social media are seen as very or somewhat effective for creating sustained social movements , Black and Hispanic users ( 82 % for both ) are more likely to say this than White Americans ( 76 % ) who use these sites . Some 77 % of Asian Americans who use social media say these sites are at least somewhat effective for this aim .
Economic Pessimism Persists . The survey was conducted before Friday 's jobs report , which showed that the unemployment rate had fallen to 6.3 % , its lowest level since 2008 , and that the economy had added 288,000 jobs . However , more than 800,000 people left the labor force . From the public 's point of view , jobs remain scarce : 65 % say jobs in their community are difficult to find while 27 % say there are plenty of jobs available . Since the recession , perceptions of the job market have become less negative as the unemployment rate has declined . However , there has been virtually no change in these views since last June ( 64 % jobs hard to find ) , although the jobless rate has fallen by more than a percentage point ( from 7.5 % to 6.3 % ) since then .
There are age and educational differences in how people rate their own ideology . Among adults under 50 , more place their ideology at the liberal ( 23 % ) than conservative ( 17 % ) end of the scale . Among those 50 and older the ideological balance is reversed : 34 % use one of the most conservative points to describe their ideology , while 19 % use one of the most liberal points .
Immigration : Most Americans say immigrants strengthen the country with their hard work and talents ( 65 % ) , rather than say that immigrants burden the country by taking jobs and other resources . Public views of immigrants have moved in a more positive direction over the past several years .
When asked to describe QAnon , people most often mentioned that it was a group of some kind ( 41 % ) or a conspiracy group or theory ( 44 % ) . When Americans who said they had heard at least a little about QAnon were asked to write in their own words what they thought it was , they were most likely to describe it as a group of some kind or include a more specific description of it as a conspiracy group or theory . Far fewer wrote in other kinds of descriptions . Two-in-ten mentioned that it is a right-wing group or theory ( 20 % ) or that it is a theory about child abuse or trafficking ( 20 % ) . Another 16 % connected it directly to President Donald Trump , either by saying that Trump supports the group or that the group views him as a hero , savior or victim . ( Responses could fit into more than one of these categories . )
However , there is a general consensus in China that the economic gains of recent years have not benefited everyone equally : 81 % agree with the statement the `` rich just get richer while the poor get poorer , '' and 45 % completely agree . Roughly half ( 48 % ) say the gap between rich and poor is a very serious problem , up from 41 % four years ago ( fully 87 % consider it at least a moderately big problem ) .
Negative attitudes toward Muslims are also more common on the ideological right . In Germany and France , for instance , respondents who place themselves on the right side of the political spectrum are more than twice as likely as those on the left to say they have an unfavorable opinion of Muslims .
Sudan is one of an increasing number of countries whose governments regulate the wearing of religious symbols or attire , such as head coverings for women or facial hair for men . The Pew Research Center 's latest report on global restrictions on religion finds that , as of 2011 , 53 of the 198 countries included in the study ( 27 % ) have such restrictions , up from 21 countries ( 11 % ) in 2007 . In addition to government regulations , private individuals and groups also try to enforce norms of religious attire in many countries . Our study finds that the number of countries in which women have been harassed by individuals or groups for violating religious dress codes has increased in recent years . In the latest year studied , such social hostilities over religious attire were found in 50 countries ( 25 % ) , including Sudan . Five years earlier , such incidents were reported in 14 countries ( 7 % ) . While there may not be a direct causal connection between government regulations and social hostilities involving religious attire , our data show that harassment of women over religious dress occurs more often in countries where the wearing of religious symbols and attire are regulated by any level of government .
Optimism about the national economy , which sagged in 2011 , has rebounded in the first two months of this year . Currently , 44 % say they expect economic conditions to be better a year from now , up from 34 % last month and 28 % in December . Second , economic optimism has proven fragile in the past . From October 2008 through April 2010 , 40 % or more said they expected economic conditions to get better in the next year . But by last summer , the percentage expecting things to improve had fallen to around 30 % .
As far as educational attainment , men and women overall tend to agree on the importance of a man or a woman being well educated in order to make a good spouse or partner . But college graduates are more likely than those with lower levels of education to say this is very important . Among adults ages 25 and older with a bachelor 's degree or higher , 40 % say being well educated is very important for a woman to be a good wife or partner , compared with 30 % of those with less education . When it comes to the importance of a man being well educated , 44 % of those with a bachelor 's degree or higher say this is very important , compared with 32 % of those with less education .
Mexico 's military continues to be highly rated , with about six-in-ten ( 61 % ) saying the military has a positive impact on the way things are going in the country . While the military receives the highest ratings of the groups and institutions tested , views of the military have turned less positive since last year , when 75 % said it was having a positive impact . Today the military 's ratings are similar to what they were in 2011 ( 62 % ) , the peak year of drug-related homicides in Mexico . Trends in the views of police influence follow a similar pattern .
The rising price of gasoline replaced the Iraq war last week as the public 's most closely followed news story . More than half of the public ( 52 % ) paid very close attention to news about gas prices , and 27 % said this was the single news story they followed more closely than any other . By comparison , 33 % followed the situation in Iraq very closely , and 23 % listed Iraq as their top news story of the week . Historically , rising gas prices have attracted broad public interest . A year ago , even more Americans ( 69 % ) followed news about gas prices very closely . This past week , interest in gas prices outstripped media coverage of the issue by a wide margin . The national news media devoted 4 % of its coverage to gasoline prices , making it the sixth most heavily covered news story of the week .
That two such dissimilar elections could generate such similar Electoral College margins illustrates an abiding feature of the United States ' quirky way of choosing its top executive : The Electoral College consistently produces more lopsided results than the popular vote . Looking back at every presidential election since 1828 ( when they began to resemble today 's system ) , the winner 's electoral vote share has , on average , been 1.36 times his popular vote share – what we call the electoral vote inflation ( EVI ) factor . The bigger the EVI , the greater the disparity between the winner 's popular vote and electoral vote margins ; the smaller the EVI , the closer the two margins are to each other . Based on the reported popular vote to date and the expected vote in the Electoral College , Biden 's EVI is 1.11 – smaller , in fact , than Trump 's in 2016 ( 1.23 ) , and the smallest since George W. Bush 's two victories in 2000 and 2004 ( 1.05 both times ) .
Women continue to bear a heavier burden when it comes to balancing work and family , despite progress in recent decades to bring about gender equality in the workplace . A 2013 Pew Research Center survey found that , among parents with at least some work experience , mothers with children under age 18 were about three times as likely as fathers to say that being a working parent made it harder for them to advance in their job or career ( 51 % vs. 16 % ) .
In an October 2010 report , `` After the Great Recession : Foreign Born Gain Jobs ; Native Born Lose Jobs , '' we focused on the period from the second quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009 — when most of the job losses during the Great Recession occurred — and the period from the second quarter of 2009 to the second quarter of 2010 — the first year of recovery from the recession . We found that in the year following the official end of the recession in June 2009 , foreign-born workers , who make up 15.7 % of the labor force , gained 656,000 jobs while native-born workers lost 1.2 million . As a result , the unemployment rate for immigrant workers fell 0.6 percentage points during this period ( from 9.3 % to 8.7 % ) , while for native-born workers it rose 0.5 percentage points ( from 9.2 % to 9.7 % ) . But the jobs recovery has been far from complete for either group of workers . From the beginning of the recession in the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2010 , native-born workers lost 6.1 million jobs , a drop of 4.9 % , and foreign-born workers lost 262,000 jobs , or a drop of 1.2 % . The unemployment rate for native-born workers is up from 4.6 % to 9.0 % and for immigrants it is up from 4.5 % to 9.9 % .
A Pew Research Center analysis of government data published earlier this month found that 36 % of the nation 's young adults ages 18 to 31 — the so-called Millennial generation — were living in their parents ' home in 2012 . This was the highest share in at least four decades and represented a slow but steady increase over the 32 % of their same-aged counterparts who were living at home prior to the Great Recession in 2007 . The growing gender parity in likelihood of residing at home is especially pronounced among 18- to 24-year-olds : 60 % of men and 52 % of women in that age group lived at home in 2012 , an 8-percentage-point gap . In 1968 , 59 % of male 18- to 24-year-olds , but only 42 % of females lived at home : a difference of 17 percentage points .
Among Americans overall , there is widespread agreement around which groups have too much power in today 's economy . About eight-in-ten or more adults say politicians ( 84 % ) , large corporations ( 82 % ) and wealthy people ( 82 % ) have too much power and influence . About three-quarters ( 74 % ) say health insurance companies have too much power , and majorities say the same about banks and other financial institutions ( 64 % ) and technology companies ( 61 % ) .
Trump 's approval rating is broadly positive among independents who say they lean toward the Republican Party , though not quite as high as among self-identified Republicans . As of August 2020 , 62 % of GOP leaners say they approve of the way Trump is handling his job in office , compared with 86 % of Republican identifiers .
European publics tend to want less immigration . A median of 51 % believe their country should allow fewer immigrants or none at all , while 35 % think the number of immigrants should stay about the same . Just 10 % want more .
In all , Europe received some 2.5 million first-time asylum applications in 2015 and 2016 . The European country with the most applications in the past two years has been Germany , which received nearly half ( 45 % ) of these applications , followed by Hungary ( 8 % ) , Italy ( 8 % ) and Sweden ( 7 % ) . Both Italy and Greece continue to receive new arrivals on their shores , but Italy received more than Greece in 2016 .
In a 2011 Pew Research Center survey , 64 % said American parents were not putting enough pressure on their children to do well in school ; just 11 % felt parents were putting too much pressure on their kids and 21 % thought the amount of pressure was about right . The view that parents were not pushing their kids hard enough was especially common among 30 to 49 year-olds ( 72 % ) , the age group most likely to have children under age 18 . Globally , Americans stand out on this question . Among 21 nations polled , the U.S. had the highest percentage saying parents should apply more pressure . Views were quite different in China , the only country where a majority ( 68 % ) said parents put too much pressure on their children to succeed in school . The Chinese education system 's intense focus on test-taking has received a fair amount of attention in recent years , especially after Shanghai students topped the rankings for math , science , and reading on the 2009 Program for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) exam . But apparently many Chinese believed the long hours of test prep – according to the OECD 80 % of Shanghai students have after school tutoring – were a bit too much .
In the March 2005 estimate more than 40 % of the unauthorized population or 4.4 million persons had been in the country since 2000 . ( Figure 1 )
There also are sizable generational differences in opinions about immigrants . Three-quarters of Millennials ( 75 % ) say immigrants strengthen rather than burden the U.S. That compares with 63 % of Gen Xers , 52 % of Baby Boomers and 44 % in the Silent Generation . In 1994 , roughly comparable shares of Gen Xers , Boomers and Silents expressed positive views of immigrants .
While there has been no significant change in party affiliation this year , there are other signs of evangelical frustration with the party . The number of evangelicals who have a favorable opinion of the GOP stood at 74 % in the aftermath of the 2004 election . But it dropped to 54 % last fall in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , before recovering to 63 % earlier in 2006 . By July of this year , however , it had declined to 54 % , as the party 's image with the public overall dimmed to 40 % favorable .
YouTube is the second-largest social networking site , behind Facebook . A 2014 Pew Research Center study of online adults found that three-quarters ( 77 % ) of internet users are on Facebook , while 63 % use YouTube . Although YouTube has a smaller reach than Facebook , it is more widely used than LinkedIn ( 25 % ) , Google Plus ( 24 % ) and Twitter ( 21 % ) .
The public sees China in less negative terms than Russia . Still , 43 % consider China a serious problem ( but not an adversary ) ; about a third ( 34 % ) say China is not much of a problem , while just 16 % consider China an adversary . The share that considers China an adversary has edged down 6 points since early 2017 .
Though many Americans apparently do n't realize it , the U.S. is producing considerably more of its own energy . Last year the U.S. generated a record 79.1 quadrillion Btu ( British thermal units ) domestically , nearly 14 % more energy than in 2005 , largely due to increased production of oil and natural gas . Beginning in 2011 , natural gas supplanted coal as the nation 's single-biggest source of domestically produced energy , according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration . In the first half of this year , 11.95 trillion cubic feet of `` dry '' ( or consumer-grade ) natural gas were produced , slightly above the same period last year and 7.9 % more than in the first six months of 2011 .
Afro-Latinos are one of these Latino identity groups . They are characterized by their diverse views of racial identity , reflecting the complex and varied nature of race and identity among Latinos . A Pew Research Center survey of Latino adults shows that one-quarter of all U.S. Latinos self-identify as Afro-Latino , Afro-Caribbean or of African descent with roots in Latin America . This is the first time a nationally representative survey in the U.S. has asked the Latino population directly whether they considered themselves Afro-Latino .
Roughly one-in-four ( 27 % ) very closely followed news last week about the police shooting of African American teenager Michael Brown and subsequent protests in Ferguson , Missouri . Several other stories garnered similar interest , including the death of actor Robin Williams ( 27 % ) and news about the Ebola outbreak in Africa ( 25 % ) . Similar shares also tracked news about U.S. airstrikes in Iraq ( 23 % ) and the situation between Russia and Ukraine ( 22 % ) .
Africa is the only world region projected to have strong population growth for the rest of this century . Between 2020 and 2100 , Africa 's population is expected to increase from 1.3 billion to 4.3 billion . Projections show these gains will come mostly in sub-Saharan Africa , which is expected to more than triple in population by 2100 . The regions that include the United States and Canada ( Northern America ) and Australia and New Zealand ( Oceania ) are projected to grow throughout the rest of the century , too , but at slower rates than Africa . ( This analysis uses regional classifications from the UN and may differ from other Pew Research Center reports . )
They were also much more likely to say the country needs to continue to make changes to ensure blacks have equal rights with whites . Fully eight-in-ten blacks ( 81 % ) said so , compared with just over a third ( 36 % ) of whites .
Unauthorized immigrants of working age have substantially different patterns of labor force participation than do people born in the U.S . Unauthorized immigrant men of working age are considerably more likely to be in the workforce than U.S.-born men ( 91 % versus 79 % ) . For women , the opposite is true ; only 61 % of unauthorized immigrant women are in the labor force , compared with 72 % of U.S.-born women . For both genders , substantial portions of the U.S.-born population of working age are not in the labor force because they are attending school , retired or disabled , but that is true for only a small share of unauthorized immigrants . A major difference for women is that a higher share of unauthorized immigrant women say they are not working and have young children at home ( 22 % ) compared with other immigrants ( 13 % ) and U.S.-born women ( 7 % ) . While there have been some modest changes in labor force participation rates over the past 20 years , the participation of unauthorized immigrant men and women , relative to the U.S.-born population and legal immigrants , has remained essentially unchanged since 2005 .
The rise in intense Indian support for trade reflects a widely shared perception that international commerce benefits individuals . Contrary to public opinion in the U.S. , Europe and Japan , a majority of Indians believe trade with other countries leads to an increase in wages ( 57 % ) and creates jobs ( 56 % ) . And such sentiment is up slightly from 2014 . Few Indian adults believe trade kills jobs ( 15 % ) or undermines wages ( 13 % ) . At the same time , roughly half of Indians ( 52 % ) say trade increases prices , a sentiment that is widely shared in other emerging markets yet is contrary to economic theory that international commerce should lead to falling prices .
Yet the overall trend on whether it is more important to control gun ownership or protect gun rights has edged back in the direction of gun rights . And when it comes to the importance of gun policy as a voting issue , gun rights supporters have the advantage . In the days after the school shooting in Newtown , Conn. last December , more prioritized gun control than gun rights ( 49 % vs. 42 % ) , the first time this had occurred since Barack Obama became president . Roughly five months later , the public is again evenly divided over whether in general it is more important to control gun ownership ( 50 % ) or to protect the rights of Americans to own guns ( 48 % ) . This mirrors the close divide in opinion that existed prior to Newtown . ( See Pew Research Center 's 20 years of public opinion data on gun rights and gun control . )
Roughly four-in-ten Americans ages 65 and older ( 38 % ) often get news from a mobile device , around six times the share in 2013 . In fact , people in this age group are now roughly as likely to get news from a mobile device as they are to get it from a desktop or laptop ( 38 % vs. 34 % ) .
Public views on military defense spending have shifted substantially over the past quarter-century . In 1990 , during George H.W . Bush 's presidency , 40 % wanted to decrease defense spending and just 18 % favored increasing it . By contrast , in February 2002 , following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , a 60 % majority backed increased spending on military defense , with just 5 % saying spending should be lowered . Currently , there is no public consensus on defense spending : 32 % say it should be increased , virtually unchanged from 31 % two years ago . About a quarter ( 24 % ) say it should be decreased , down from 30 % in 2011 . And a plurality ( 41 % ) say defense spending should be kept the same .
Both the public and the media focused most closely last week on the congressional elections as Tuesday 's midterm vote approached . Still , the public 's interest in election news did not increase in the final days of the campaign , despite heavy news coverage . The latest News Interest Index survey , conducted among 1,003 adults from Oct. 28 to Nov. 1 , the day before the midterm election , finds that 29 % said they were following news about the congressional elections very closely ; that is little changed from 30 % a week earlier and 33 % in mid-October .
Those in every country surveyed worry about the impact of mobile phones on children . Across these 11 emerging economies , a median of 79 % of adults say people should be very concerned about children being exposed to harmful or immoral content when using their phones . In most countries , half or more say mobile phones and the internet have had a bad impact on children – more than the percentage who say they are concerned about the influence of technology on other facets of society included in the survey , such as politics , local culture and morality . While mobile phone users largely agree that their phones help them get news , many are concerned about the spread of misinformation when using their phone . A median of 79 % of mobile phone users across the 11 countries surveyed say their mobile phones have helped them get information and news about important issues . Smartphone users are particularly likely to say their devices bring these benefits compared with those with more basic devices . But , these perceived benefits can often coexist with concerns . A median of 64 % of adults also say people should be very concerned about exposure to false or incorrect information when using their mobile phones .
Concerns over U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria also differ by age . Adults under the age of 30 express more concern about the U.S. going too far in getting involved in the situation ( 55 % ) than not going far enough to stop the Islamic militants ( 37 % ) . All older age groups say they are more concerned about the U.S. not doing enough to stop Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria than getting too involved in the situation . Wide partisan divides exist over whether the U.S. should send ground troops . Two-thirds of Republicans ( 66 % ) – including 72 % of conservative Republicans – say they would favor sending U.S. ground troops to Iraq and Syria , while just 28 % are opposed . Among Democrats , views are the reverse : 64 % oppose sending ground troops to Iraq and Syria , 33 % are in favor . Among independents , about as many favor ( 48 % ) as oppose ( 47 % ) the use of U.S. ground forces to fight Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria . Views among partisan groups are little different than they were in July 2015 .
Nearly a quarter ( 23 % ) of the public says they followed news about projections of a record high federal budget deficit this year very closely ; 5 % say this was the story they followed most closely . The media devoted 4 % of coverage to the deficit projections . Fewer ( 13 % ) say they very closely followed news about recent gains in the stock market ; 4 % say this was the news they followed most closely . News about the stock market accounted for less than 1 % of the coverage analyzed by PEJ . Meanwhile , 14 % say they very closely followed news about a suicide bombing in Russia that killed at least 35 people ; 3 % say this was the news they followed most closely . The story accounted for 2 % of coverage .
Two stories drew far more interest from Republicans than Democrats : 34 % of Republicans followed reports about Hillary Clinton 's use of a private email address as secretary of state very closely , compared with just 16 % of Democrats . Similarly , about twice as many Republicans ( 34 % ) as Democrats ( 18 % ) closely followed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's speech to Congress last Tuesday . There are smaller partisan differences in interest in the week 's other stories . For instance , comparable percentages of Democrats ( 26 % ) and Republicans ( 22 % ) paid very close attention to arguments at the Supreme Court over the Affordable Care Act ; 30 % of Democrats and 24 % of Republicans very closely followed news about the Department of Justice report on race and policing in Ferguson , Mo .
Nine-in-ten Lebanese Sunnis rated themselves favorably . At least seven-in-ten said the same among Lebanese Shiites ( 77 % ) and Christians ( 71 % ) – still mostly positive but lower than the rating Sunnis gave to themselves .
Americans who have never used a dating site or app are particularly skeptical about the safety of online dating . Roughly half of adults who have never used a dating or app ( 52 % ) believe that these platforms are a not too or not at all safe way to meet others , compared with 29 % of those who have online dated .
For instance , Asians are particularly optimistic about the next generation 's financial prospects . Fully 94 % of Vietnamese , 85 % of Chinese , 71 % of Bangladeshis , and 67 % of Indians think today 's children will be better off than their parents . Africans and Latin Americans are also on balance optimistic , while Middle Easterners tend to be pessimistic . And in Europe and the United States , pessimism is pervasive .
The 29 % of Democrats who use the platform are more liberal and less inclined to say the party should elect a candidate who seeks common ground with Republicans than are Democrats who are not on Twitter . They also express different preferences for who should be party 's 2020 nominee . Differences between Democrats on and off Twitter extend beyond ideology . About two-thirds of Democrats who do not use Twitter ( 65 % ) say it is more important for a Democratic candidate to seek common ground with Republicans , even if it means giving up some things Democrats want . A smaller share of Twitter-using Democrats ( 54 % ) take this view ; 45 % prefer a candidate who will push hard for policies Democrats want , even if it makes it much harder to get some things done .
Almost universally , the Chinese respondents surveyed complain about rising prices – 96 % describe rising prices as a big problem for the country , and 72 % say they are a very big problem . And nearly half ( 48 % ) of those polled say health care is difficult for their family to afford . But the Chinese are almost as concerned about equity in China as they are about inflation . About nine-in-ten ( 89 % ) identify the gap between rich and poor as a major problem and 41 % cite it as a very big problem . Worries about inequality are common among rich and poor , old and young , and men and women , as well as the college-educated and those with less education . In that regard , despite economic growth , concerns about unemployment and conditions for workers are extensive , with 68 % and 56 % reporting these as big problems , respectively .
Following the beheading of American journalist James Foley , two-thirds of the public ( 67 % ) cite ISIS as a major threat to the U.S. About two-in-ten ( 21 % ) name the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria as a `` minor threat '' and just 5 % say it is not a threat . Half of the sample was asked about ISIS and the other half was asked about the broader threat of `` Islamic extremist groups like al Qaeda , '' which registered similar concern ( 71 % major threat , 19 % minor threat , 6 % not a threat ) . In light of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa , roughly half ( 52 % ) believe the spread of infectious diseases between countries is a major threat and four-in-ten ( 40 % ) label it a minor threat . However , the public shows less concern today about the international spread of diseases than it did in May 2001 : About two-thirds ( 66 % ) then said it was a major threat , following an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the U.K. and the ongoing `` mad cow disease '' . About half ( 48 % ) label the continuing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians as a major threat to the U.S . The same share rates China 's emergence as a world power and global climate change as major .
Currently , whites remain divided in their views of Trump : Half ( 50 % ) approve of the job Trump is doing as president , while 45 % disapprove . Blacks ( 85 % ) and Hispanics ( 74 % ) overwhelmingly disapprove of Trump 's job performance .
As Egyptians head to the polls , the economy is their biggest concern , according to the Pew survey conducted March 19 to April 10 . Roughly eight-in-ten ( 81 % ) consider improving the economy a very important priority for the country . Only 27 % describe the current economic situation as good . And regardless of which candidate wins the presidency , he will face high economic expectations – 50 % think the economy will improve in the next 12 months ; just 20 % say it will get worse . Moreover , Egyptians do not just voice support for democracy in a general sense – they also want specific democratic rights and institutions . In particular , they want a fair judiciary : 81 % consider it is very important to live in a country with a judicial system that treats everyone in the same way . About six-in-ten say it is very important to live in a country with a free press ( 62 % ) ; free speech ( 60 % ) ; and honest , competitive elections with at least two political parties ( 58 % ) . In addition to these fundamental components of democracy , Egyptians also want order : 60 % rate law and order as very important .
As the 2020 presidential campaign ramps up , a growing share of Americans say it is likely that Russia or other foreign governments will attempt to influence the November election . At the same time , confidence in the federal government to prevent election interference by foreign governments has declined .
News about problems with the medical care of wounded Iraq war veterans drew the public 's attention last week . More than three-in-ten Americans ( 31 % ) paid very close attention to news about conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and more general reports about how soldiers returning from Iraq are being cared for . And 20 % said this was the story they followed most closely , making it the second most closely followed news story of the week . The situation in Iraq continued to be the dominant news story both in terms of interest and coverage . Even the announcement of a verdict in the Scooter Libby trial failed to generate much public interest , in spite of the news media 's intense focus on the story . Only 13 % of the public followed the Libby verdict very closely and 7 % named it as the story they followed most closely last week . Interest was up only moderately from January and February , when the trial was ongoing . In terms of news coverage , the Libby story made up 13 % of the overall newshole for the week putting it ahead of the presidential campaign and the Walter Reed story . It was the top story on cable television with 18 % of cable news devoted to the verdict . In other top stories , the public continued to pay fairly close attention to news about the 2008 presidential campaign . Nearly one-quarter of the public followed this story very closely , and 13 % said it was their top story of the week . Nine percent of news coverage for the week was devoted to the campaign . News about the recent Mega Millions lottery jackpot was followed very closely by 9 % of the public , 3 % listed this as the story they followed most closely ( 1 % of the week 's news was devoted to this story ) .
In Western Europe , slim majorities in Germany ( 54 % ) , Britain ( 53 % ) and France ( 51 % ) support raising prices to address climate change . Opinions are almost equally split among the Spanish ( 49 % agree vs. 48 % disagree ) .
The nationwide survey by the Pew Research Center , conducted Oct. 30-Nov. 6 , 2013 among 996 adults nationwide , finds 44 % in favor of prohibiting restaurants from using trans fats in foods , while 52 % oppose the idea . While this is not the sweeping policy proposed by the FDA today , a number of cities have put such restrictions in place . This question is part of a Pew Research Center survey on how Americans view public health and obesity that will be released early next week .
On the issue of marijuana policy , more continue to say marijuana use should be legal ( 52 % ) than illegal ( 45 % ) , and public views about marijuana are little changed over the last year .
Partisanship plays a role in public opinion of the impact of mobile technology . Adults who support Modi 's BJP are more likely to say mobile phones have had a good influence on politics ( 49 % ) than those who support the Congress party ( 33 % ) . Last September , the president of the BJP encouraged the party 's supporters to spread pro-BJP messages on WhatsApp and other social media platforms – whether those messages are `` true or fake . ''
There was also a substantial age gap in these views : Just 45 % of adults younger than 30 said the quality of congressional candidates in their district 's last several elections was good . By contrast , more than six-in-ten of those in older age groups said this , including about three-quarters of those 65 and older ( 77 % ) . Younger people also tended to offer more negative evaluations of past candidate pools for other levels of office . ( The age gap is partly the result of younger people being less likely to identify as partisans , but a gap remains even when that is taken into account . )
But the perception that communities recycle `` most types of items '' obscures the markedly different rates at which various types of waste actually are recycled or composted . According to our analysis of the EPA data , 99 % of lead-acid batteries ( the sort found in cars and trucks ) , 88.5 % of corrugated cardboard boxes , and 67 % of newspapers , directories and the like were recycled as of 2013 . On the other hand , only 28.2 % of high-density polyethylene containers ( such as milk jugs ) were recycled , as were 13.5 % of plastic bags and wraps and only 6.2 % of small appliances . Three-fifths ( 60.2 % ) of yard trimmings were composted , but just 5 % of food waste was . One category of solid waste that 's grown rapidly , in both quantity generated and amount recycled , is consumer electronics – TVs , computer equipment , phones , DVD players and the like . According to the EPA report , 40.4 % of the 3.1 million tons of consumer electronics that entered the wastestream in 2013 were recycled , up from 30.6 % in 2012 .
While there have been some notable challenges in using this type of technology in medicine , most Americans predict it to be the norm in the coming decades . Roughly eight-in-ten U.S. adults ( 79 % ) say that in the next 20 years doctors will use computer programs to diagnose and treat most diseases , including 21 % who say this will definitely happen . The Center 's survey finds that roughly two-thirds of Americans expect that in the next 20 years most stores will probably ( 52 % ) or definitely ( 13 % ) be fully automated and involve little interaction between customers and employees .
•More people say they mostly get news `` from time to time '' rather than at `` regular times . '' The percentage of so-called news grazers has increased nine points ( from 48 % to 57 % ) since 2006 .
Most in the region worry about China 's growing military power . China 's official military budget grew by about 9 % per year over the past decade , and few of its neighbors appear to welcome the increase . In South Korea , Japan and Vietnam – countries actively engaged in disputes with China over military deployments or territory in the East and South China seas – nine-in-ten or more think China 's growing military power is a bad thing for their country . In India , even before a recent border dispute in the Himalayas , people had a negative view of Beijing by a more than three-to-one margin . Although China 's power and influence is not seen as a top threat globally , many in Asia-Pacific countries see it a key concern . Outside the region , a median of 27 % see China 's power and influence as a major threat to their country . But among the seven Asia-Pacific countries surveyed , a median of 47 % see it as a major threat . South Koreans and Vietnamese even rate China 's power and influence as the top threat facing their nations . Concerns about China also outpace concerns about the United States across the region ; a median of 35 % say U.S. power and influence is a major threat to their country .
Internet use is most widespread in Jordan and Lebanon , where 87 % of adults in each country go online . About eight-in-ten adults also go online in the Latin American countries of Mexico ( 81 % ) , Colombia ( 80 % ) and Venezuela ( 77 % ) .
Overall , voters are less confident that their vote will be accurately counted in the upcoming election than they were in 2008 and 2004 . In both 2008 ( 57 % ) and 2004 ( 62 % ) , a majority of voters were `` very '' confident , compared with just under half who feel this way today ( 49 % ) .
Solid majorities of higher-income internet users research products ( 88 % ) , make travel reservations online ( 83 % ) , purchase products or services online ( 81 % ) , perform online banking ( 74 % ) , use the internet to pay bills ( 71 % ) , and use online classified sites such as Craigslist ( 60 % ) .1 , 2 , 3
In spring 2008 , before America experienced the worst of the recession , 46 % in the U.S. and a median of 44 % across five European Union nations – the UK , France , Germany , Poland and Spain – picked the U.S. as the top economy . And even though China was humming along at 9.6 % annual growth , only 26 % of Americans and a median of 29 % in the EU countries said China was the world 's economic leader .
There were just over 5 million job openings on the last business day of 2014 ( after adjusting for seasonal variations ) , according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey ( known as JOLTS ) , which is produced by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics . While that was little changed from November 's level , it was the highest figure since January 2001 , just before the dot-com bust . While job openings have been increasing since the latter part of 2009 , the pace accelerated markedly last year .
Because of inherent uncertainties in the residual technique , the difference in successive annual estimates of the unauthorized population is not a valid measure of growth . However , it is possible to use differences taken over longer intervals to measure growth . Thus , the average annual change over the 2000 - 2004 period is about 485,000 or 10.3 million minus 8.4 million divided by 4 . For the entire decade of the 1990s , growth averaged just about 500,000 per year . However , there are a number of data sources that point to substantially larger growth increments at the very end of the 1990s ( and possibly at the end of the 1980s and the very early 1990s ) .
In this early phase of the drive for open government and open data , people 's activities tend to be simple . Their connection to open data could be as routine as finding out the hours of a local park ; or it could be transactional , such as paying a fine or renewing a license .
But not all of those parents may buy their own reassurances : Nearly one-in-five U.S. adults ( 18 % ) say they 've seen or been in the presence of a ghost , according to a 2009 Pew Research Center survey . An even greater share – 29 % – say they have felt in touch with someone who has already died .
In order to compare the religiosity of Catholic publics in Europe , Latin America , and the U.S. , we constructed an index based on three questions : whether faith in God is necessary for living a moral life , the importance of religion in respondents ' lives , and a how often respondents pray .2 The scale ranges from `` 0 , '' the least religious position , to `` 3 , '' the most religious position . Among the 13 nations included in the analysis , Brazilian Catholics have the highest religiosity score ( 2.45 ) , and the top six spots all belong to Latin American countries . Latin American Catholics tend to cluster in the upper left of the chart , indicating their low levels of wealth and high levels of religiosity , while those in Western Europe show up in the lower right as the result of their prosperity and lower scores on the religiosity index . Most countries appear in the chart about where their stage of economic development would predict . For example , on this chart , Argentina does not look like an outlier ; instead , it falls precisely where it should given its comparative wealth in relation to other Latin American nations .
The Census Bureau 's biannual Current Population Survey November Voting and Registration Supplement is the most comprehensive data source available for examining the demographic composition of the electorate in federal elections . However , because it relies on post-election self-reporting by survey respondents in some 55,000 households , these weighted CPS estimates of turnout never match up precisely with the actual number of votes tallied in the 50 states . According to the CPS , an estimated 131.1 million U.S. citizens voted in the 2008 presidential election – slightly less than the 131.3 million votes cast for president , as reported by the Center for the Study of the American Electorate ( Gans , 2008 ) and other sources ( McDonald , 2009 ) .
An overwhelming majority of police officers ( 86 % ) said in 2016 that high-profile fatal encounters between black people and police officers had made their jobs harder . Sizable majorities also said such incidents had made their colleagues more worried about safety ( 93 % ) , heightened tensions between police and blacks ( 75 % ) , and left many officers reluctant to use force when appropriate ( 76 % ) or to question people who seemed suspicious ( 72 % ) .
The public continued to focus most closely last week on the economy as new jobless numbers and other data reaffirmed the slow pace of the recovery . About a quarter ( 26 % ) say this was the story they followed most closely ; 36 % say they followed news about the economy very closely . About two-in-ten ( 19 % ) say they very closely followed news about problems with how banks and other financial institutions have been handling foreclosures ; 6 % say this was the news they followed most closely . In terms of coverage , the nation 's economic troubles accounted for 11 % of the newshole last week . That included 9 % for economic news in general and 2 % for news focused on the foreclosure problems , according to the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism . Nearly a quarter ( 23 % ) say they followed news about the upcoming midterm congressional elections very closely ; 15 % say this was the news they followed most closely . The media devoted 25 % of coverage to the campaigns . That made the elections the most covered story of the week as has been the case for the past four weeks .
Publics in the U.S. and Britain are the strongest supporters of the idea that use of military force is sometimes necessary , with 75 % of Americans and 70 % of those in Britain holding that view . In Spain , 62 % say use of force is sometimes necessary while Germans are evenly divided with half saying the use of force is sometimes necessary and half saying it is not .
The survey finds continued public pessimism about the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan . A majority ( 56 % ) says the United States has mostly failed in achieving its goals in Afghanistan ; 36 % say the United States has mostly succeeded . These views are little changed from early last year .
On the eve of the final mission of the U.S. space shuttle program , most Americans say the United States must be at the forefront of future space exploration . Fifty years after the first American manned space flight , nearly six-in-ten ( 58 % ) say it is essential that the United States continue to be a world leader in space exploration ; about four-in-ten say this is not essential ( 38 % ) .
Many parents struggle to find high-quality , affordable child care or after-school activities or programs . About four-in-ten parents with school-aged children ( 39 % ) say it 's hard to find high-quality , affordable after-school activities and programs for their children in their community , and this is especially the case for lower-income parents .
That survey found that about half of Indian Americans ( 51 % ) identify as Hindus , while 5 % identify as Sikhs and 2 % as Jains ( two other religious groups that also observe Diwali ) . Most of the rest are Christians ( 18 % ) , Muslims ( 10 % ) or people unaffiliated with any religion ( 10 % ) .
That study also found that a plurality of Americans ( 41 % ) believe that President Bush should choose someone who will keep the court about the same as it is now , while roughly equal numbers support a more conservative nominee ( 28 % ) , or a more liberal one ( 24 % ) . Only two groups , Enterprisers ( 64 % ) and Social Conservatives ( 50 % ) , clearly favor a choice that would make the court more conservative . In five of the other groups , pluralities ­ or , in the case of Upbeats and Disaffecteds , majorities ­ feel that the president should choose someone who would keep the court 's ideological balance about the same as it is now . Most Liberals ( 52 % ) would prefer a nominee who will make the court more liberal .
Western Europeans with populist views are less likely than non-populists to say the news media are very important to the functioning of their country 's society . This pattern appeared in seven of eight Western European countries surveyed by Pew Research Center in 2017 ( the exception was Spain ) . The differences in views between populists and non-populists were even more pronounced than the differences between those who place themselves on the ideological left and right . In the Netherlands , for example , populists were 20 points less likely than non-populists to say the news media are very important to the functioning of society ( 35 % vs. 55 % ) . The left-right difference on this question was only 8 points . Most people say news organizations in their country are doing well at reporting on the most important news events , according to a 2017 survey of 38 countries . Ratings of the news media were measured , however : Across the nations surveyed , a median of just 26 % said the news media were doing very well at reporting on the most important news events . Ratings of the media were highest in sub-Saharan Africa and the Asia-Pacific region , where medians of 82 % and 74 % , respectively , said that the media were doing well at covering the most important news stories . Majorities in Greece and South Korea said the media were not doing well at covering the most important stories .
Second , people believe that technologies that would bring more dramatic or extreme changes to human abilities are less acceptable than technologies that cause less dramatic or temporary changes . For example , 47 % of Americans consider the use of synthetic blood substitutes to improve physical abilities an `` appropriate use of technology '' if the resulting change to people 's speed , strength and stamina would be `` equal to their own peak abilities . '' But if the same enhancement results in physical abilities `` far above that of any human known to date , '' far fewer ( 28 % ) say it would be an appropriate use of technology . The same pattern occurs as Americans consider the potential use of gene editing and devices implanted in the brain to augment human abilities .
The Taliban , which has a base of operations on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan , is seen unfavorably by 59 % of the population in Pakistan . Only 8 % have a favorable view of this extremist organization , with a third of Pakistanis not offering an opinion . Views of the Taliban have not changed substantially in recent years . Opinions toward specific branches of the Taliban , such as Tehrik-i-Taliban and the Afghan Taliban , are also negative . In a spring 2013 survey , both those groups received low ratings ( 56 % unfavorable and 47 % unfavorable , respectively ) .
Three-quarters of voters ( 75 % ) can correctly identify Illinois as the state Obama represented in the U.S. Senate , while 60 % identify Massachusetts as the state in which Romney served as governor . Roughly six-in-ten ( 61 % ) know that Bain Capital is the company Romney once headed .
In the U.S. , Christians are particularly likely ( 99 % ) to believe in God or a higher power , with 80 % claiming faith in a biblical God . Three-quarters of Christians describe God as all-loving , all-knowing and all-powerful . Like Christians , most Jews ( 89 % ) have faith in a deity . But just a third of Jews ( 33 % ) say they believe in God as described in the Bible , while 56 % say they believe in some other higher power . Jews are also more likely than Christians to say they do n't believe in a spiritual force of any kind ( 10 % vs. 1 % ) . Finally , among those who describe themselves as religiously unaffiliated – also known as `` nones '' – 72 % say they believe in a higher power of some kind .
Few Americans name Germany as their country 's most or second-most important foreign policy partner , but about a third of Germans name the U.S. Only 9 % in the U.S. name Germany as one of their top two foreign affairs partners , far fewer than the 37 % who name the UK and 26 % who name China . Since 2017 the share of Americans saying Canada is their country 's first- or second-priority partner has increased to 25 % . In fact , Germany is no longer among the top five countries cited by Americans .
But despite all these reservations , views about what occurred in Selma were another matter . By a 48 % to 21 % margin , a Harris poll in May 1965 found its respondents saying they sided more with the civil rights groups involved than with the state of Alabama . Not unexpectedly , virtually all of the black respondents sided more with the demonstrators ( 95 % ) , but the balance of opinion among whites was also clearly with them rather than with the state of Alabama ( 46 % to 21 % ) .
The U.S. electorate is aging : 52 % of registered voters are ages 50 and older , up from 41 % in 1996 . This shift has occurred in both partisan coalitions . More than half of Republican and GOP-leaning voters ( 56 % ) are ages 50 and older , up from 39 % in 1996 . And among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters , half are 50 and older , up from 41 % in 1996 . Another way to consider the aging of the electorate is to look at median age . The median age among all registered voters increased from 44 in 1996 to 50 in 2019 . It rose from 43 to 52 among Republican registered voters and from 45 to 49 among Democratic registered voters .
Growth has slowed sharply in recent years . According to Cuba 's national statistical agency , the country 's gross domestic product in 2013 was 77.2 billion pesos – which , depending on which exchange rate one uses , could equate to anything from $ 77.2 billion ( at the official rate of 1 convertible peso to $ 1 ) to $ 3.2 billion ( at the internal rate of 24 regular pesos to 1 convertible peso ) . But either way , growth has slowed dramatically from the mid-2000s : The CIA estimates that Cuba 's GDP grew just 1.3 % last year in real ( inflation-adjusted ) terms – 177th out of 222 countries ranked . One big reason : With global oil prices still well below their pre-recession highs , the heavily discounted oil that Venezuela sends Cuba – some of which Cuba re-exports – is less valuable .
Asked what will happen if many of the everyday interactions they have in person have to be done online or by phone because of the coronavirus outbreak , 27 % say these technologies will be just as good as in-person contact . By comparison , the largest share ( 64 % ) says these tools will be useful , but will not be a replacement for face-to-face communications , and just 8 % say the internet or phones wo n't help much at all during this time . This pattern holds true across each major demographic group . Still , there are some notable differences by educational attainment . Roughly three-quarters of college graduates ( 73 % ) say that if their everyday in-person interactions have to be done online or by phone , it will help but not be a replacement for in-person contact . That share falls to 63 % among those who have some college experience and 56 % among Americans with a high school education or less .
Yet there is broad public skepticism that a thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations will lead to greater democracy in Cuba . Only about a third ( 32 % ) say they think Cuba will become more democratic over the next several years , while 60 % say it will be about the same as it is now .
Economic problems now top the public 's list of national concerns , with roughly one-in-three ( 34 % ) citing economic problems as the nation 's most grave , compared with 27 % who say the war in Iraq is the biggest problem facing the nation . This represents a reversal from a year ago , when 42 % cited Iraq as the most important problem in the wake of Bush 's proposal to increase the number of troops there . As recently as September , 37 % of Americans cited Iraq as the nation 's biggest problem , nearly double the 20 % who cited economic problems . But current views are more in line with public opinion in 2005 and 2006 , when roughly equal numbers cited economic concerns and Iraq as the nation 's biggest problem .
At the same time , Catholics in Mexico do not uniformly agree with Catholic Church teachings . Half of Mexican Catholics think gays and lesbians should be permitted to legally marry ( a right that exists in certain parts of the country ) , compared with 42 % who side with church policy and oppose gay marriage . Mexican Catholics lean in the opposite direction when homosexuality is framed in terms of morality : 55 % say homosexual behavior is morally wrong ( compared with 21 % who say it is morally acceptable and 17 % who say it is not a moral issue ) . Even fewer Catholics in Mexico say sex outside marriage ( 45 % ) , divorce ( 32 % ) and contraception ( 28 % ) are morally wrong – all of which are behaviors seen as sinful by the Catholic Church . In fact , most Mexican Catholics say the church should allow contraceptive use ( 66 % ) and divorce ( 60 % ) , roughly similar to the shares of U.S. Hispanic Catholics who support these changes to church teachings .
In the Senate , lawmakers spend an average 317 calendar days in session during a two-year congressional term , according to the Center 's analysis .
Americans are more likely to see social media as providing connections with others than causing negative experiences . While prior Center research has found that exposure to social media content may indirectly make some people feel stressed , Americans say they are more likely to find connection online than to have negative experiences . In a 2018 survey of U.S. social media users , a majority ( 71 % ) said they frequently or sometimes see content that makes them feel connected on social media . Fewer said they encountered negative content , though 49 % said they frequently or sometimes see things that make them feel depressed and 31 % said they frequently or sometimes see content that makes them feel lonely .
While the future of the Affordable Care Act is in question , the public increasingly thinks the law has had a positive impact on the country . Today , more Americans say the 2010 health care overhaul has had a mostly positive than mostly negative effect on the country ( 44 % versus 35 % ) , while 14 % say it has not had much effect . As recently as April 2016 , more Americans thought the law had had a negative impact on the country ( 44 % ) than said it had a positive effect ( 39 % ) . Since 2013 , the share of Americans saying the law has had a positive effect on the country has increased 20 percentage points , from 24 % to 44 % . In addition , the share saying the law has had a positive personal effect has ticked up over the past year . Today , about as many say its effect on them and their families has been mostly positive ( 28 % ) as say mostly negative ( 24 % ) ; nearly half ( 48 % ) say it has not had much personal effect . In April 2016 , somewhat more said the law had impacted them negatively ( 31 % ) than positively ( 23 % ) ; 45 % said it had not much of an effect .
Similarly , knowledge of basic scientific concepts differs greatly across questions . While most Americans ( 78 % ) know that the basic function of red blood cells is to carry oxygen to all parts of the body , just 20 % could identify nitrogen as the gas that makes up most of the atmosphere .
Nonetheless , about half ( 51 % ) of Americans called rising prices a `` very big problem '' in this spring 's 39-nation survey by the Pew Research Center . Nearly a third more ( 31 % ) said inflation was a `` moderately '' big problem . Concern about rising prices was particularly acute among people making less than $ 30,000 a year ( 59 % of that group called it a `` very big '' problem ) , people with no college education ( 60 % ) and African Americans ( 61 % ) .
Among those who say it is very important that the tone of political debate is respectful , attitudes on political correctness are split . Equal shares say too many are easily offended and say people need to be more careful about language to avoid offending others ( 50 % each ) .
The median adjusted monthly household income of households headed by a young adult with a bachelor 's degree has increased by about $ 1,300 in inflation-adjusted dollars from 1984 ( $ 5,960 ) to 2009 ( $ 7,232 ) . Household income gains have been even greater among households with advanced degrees ( up $ 1,500 for those headed by a 25- to 34-year-old with a master 's degree and up $ 3,400 for young adult heads with a professional or doctorate degree ) .
One reason for the shift in the gender of Chinese adoptees may be the recent easing of the country 's one-child policy , which contributed to the large share of girls who were put up for adoption in the past . According to the U.S. State Department , the pool of adoptees from China has also changed from predominantly infant girls a decade ago to being largely comprised of those with special needs or older children split evenly across genders . Increased efforts by the Chinese government to encourage domestic adoption and a stronger Chinese economy are largely responsible for the demographic shifts in the pool of Chinese adoptees . Because Chinese children make up a large share of adoptees , China has driven the broader gender shift across all international adoptees to the U.S. over the years . From 1999 to 2016 , the number of female adoptees far outnumbered males , 61 % versus 39 % . Yet in 2016 , 52 % of international adoptees were male and 48 % were female .
A 52 % majority of the public thinks a health care reform bill will pass over the next year ; 37 % say that they do not expect a bill to pass and 11 % are n't sure . Opinion on this question has been largely stable throughout the month of November . And despite the Nov. 21 procedural vote in the Senate , which allowed for debate on a bill to begin , the public did not shift its views on the prospects for reform . Respondents interviewed in the two days immediately following the vote were no more likely than those interviewed prior to the vote to say they expected a health care reform bill to pass . As has consistently been the case , Democrats are more likely than Republicans and independents to say they think a health care reform bill will pass over the next year . Two-thirds ( 66 % ) of Democrats expect a bill to pass compared with 49 % of independents and 40 % of Republicans .
About a third ( 34 % ) followed news about swine flu and its vaccine very closely , while 19 % say swine flu was their top story of the week . News coverage was comparatively modest , filling just 2 % of the newshole , according to PEJ .
Partisanship is a stronger factor in people 's beliefs about climate change than is their level of knowledge and understanding about science . In October 2019 , roughly nine-in-ten Democrats with a high level of knowledge about science ( 89 % ) said human activity contributes a great deal to climate change , compared with 41 % of Democrats with low science knowledge , based on an 11-item knowledge index . By contrast , Republicans with a high level of science knowledge were no more likely than those with a low level of knowledge to say human activity plays a strong role in climate change . A similar pattern was found regarding people 's beliefs about energy issues . These findings illustrate that the relationship between people 's level of science knowledge and their attitudes can be complex .
Most U.S adult Twitter users do n't tweet very often . A large majority of tweets come from a small minority of users . The median Twitter user produces two tweets per month , according to a 2019 study . However , among the most prolific tweeters – defined as those in the top 10 % in the number of tweets they send – the median user produces 138 tweets each month . And that group of highly prolific tweeters dominates discourse on the platform more broadly : 80 % of all tweets from American adults come from the top 10 % of tweeters .
Six-in-ten ( 61 % ) Hispanics say they have a great deal or a fair amount of confidence that the police in their local communities will do a good job enforcing the law , compared with 78 % of whites and 55 % of blacks . Just under half ( 46 % ) of Hispanics say they have confidence that police officers will not use excessive force on suspects , compared with 73 % of whites and 38 % of blacks . Similarly , just under half of Hispanics say they are confident that police officers will treat Hispanics fairly ( 45 % ) and that courts will treat Hispanics fairly ( 49 % ) . In comparison , 74 % of whites and 37 % of blacks say they have confidence that the police will treat blacks and whites equally ( Pew Social & Demographic Trends , 2007 ) .
At the same time , the percentage saying that dealing with the nation 's energy problems should be a top priority has slipped from 52 % to 45 % since last year . For the first time in five years , energy now ranks slightly lower than the environment on the public 's list of priorities .
Among Germans , there is far more support for a close relationship with Russia in the former East than in the former West . Nearly four-in-ten East Germans say that they prefer close ties with Russia , compared with only 23 % who say the same about the U.S. And West Germans are twice as likely to prefer a close relationship with the U.S. than with Russia .
People traveling in families accounted for the majority of apprehensions in fiscal 2019 , a big shift from the recent past . There were 473,682 apprehensions of `` family units '' ( defined as the number of individuals traveling in a family ) , representing 56 % of apprehensions overall and more than four times the next-highest annual total of family member apprehensions on record ( 107,212 in fiscal 2018 ) . Apprehensions of unaccompanied children ages 17 and younger also reached their highest level on record ( 76,020 in fiscal 2019 , compared with a previous high of 68,541 in fiscal 2014 ) . In all other recent years , apprehensions of individual adults far outnumbered those of family members or unaccompanied children .
The 8.1 million unauthorized immigrants who were working or looking for work in 2012 made up 5.1 % of the labor force . Both of those estimates are unchanged from 2009 . The number in the labor force has remained between 8.1 million and 8.3 million since 2007 . The share of unauthorized immigrants in the workforce peaked in 2007 , at 5.4 % .
The number of Americans who had a favorable view of gay men stands at 55 % , an 18 percentage point increase compared to a decade earlier ; 58 % had a favorable opinion of lesbians , a 19 percentage point increase over the same time span .
The terms that self-identified Hispanics use to describe themselves can provide a direct look at their views of identity and the link to their countries of birth or family origin . Among all Hispanic adults , for example , half say they most often describe themselves by their family 's country of origin or heritage , using terms such as Mexican , Cuban , Puerto Rican or Salvadoran . Another 23 % say they most often call themselves American . The other 23 % most often describe themselves as `` Hispanic '' or `` Latino , '' the pan-ethnic terms used to describe this group in the U.S. , according to the survey of self-identified Hispanics .
Nearly seven-in-ten Americans ( 69 % ) hold a favorable view of First Lady Michelle Obama ; just 21 % hold an unfavorable view . Michelle Obama 's favorability rating has rebounded from a modest dip in December 2010 and now matches her rating from June 2010 .
Older generations are more likely to see the U.S. as the world 's leading economy . In 2008 , generations differed little in their assessments of which country was the world 's leading economic power – the U.S. , China , countries in the EU or Japan . But , particularly since 2016 , generational gaps have emerged . Now , Gen Xers are more likely than Millennials to say the U.S. is the world 's leading economy ( 66 % vs. 51 % , respectively ) .
While 59 % of Millennials describe the members of their generation as self-absorbed , 49 % say they are wasteful and 43 % describe them as greedy . On all three dimensions , Millennials are significantly more critical of their generation than older age cohorts are of theirs . And while Silents are more likely than other generations to say that several positive terms describe their generation , they also are less likely to say some negative terms apply . Only about one-in-ten Silents see the people of their generation as self-absorbed ( 7 % ) , wasteful ( 10 % ) and greedy ( 8 % ) – by far the lowest shares of any cohort . There are smaller differences among generations over whether the term `` cynical '' describes people in their age cohort : 31 % of Millennials say it applies , compared with 24 % of Gen X , 16 % of Boomers and just 7 % of Silents . Relatively few across all generations – only about one-in-ten – say the term `` rigid '' applies .
Hispanics are making big inroads in college enrollment . In 2014 , 35 % of Hispanics ages 18 to 24 were enrolled in a two- or four-year college , up from 22 % in 1993 – a 13-percentage-point increase . That amounted to 2.3 million Hispanic college students in 2014 . By comparison , college enrollment during this time among blacks ( 33 % in 2014 ) increased by 8 percentage points , and among whites ( 42 % in 2014 ) the share increased 5 points . Among Asians , 64 % were enrolled in college in 2014 , a nearly 9-point increase over 1999 ( no data are available for Asians before 1999 ) . Even though more Hispanics are getting a postsecondary education than ever before , Hispanics still lag other groups in obtaining a four-year degree . As of 2014 , among Hispanics ages 25 to 29 , just 15 % of Hispanics have a bachelor 's degree or higher . By comparison , among the same age group , about 41 % of whites have a bachelor 's degree or higher ( as do 22 % of blacks and 63 % of Asians ) . This gap is due in part to the fact that Hispanics are less likely than some other groups to enroll in a four-year college , attend an academically selective college and enroll full-time .
Most Americans ( 59 % ) say climate change is affecting their local community at least some , especially those who live near a coast . Two-thirds of those who live within 25 miles of a coastline ( 67 % ) say this , compared with 59 % of those who live 25 to 299 miles from a coast and half of those who live 300 miles or more from a coast . These geographical differences exist within the parties too : Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who live within 25 miles of a coastline are more likely than those who live at least 300 miles inland to say climate change is affecting their local community . The same is true among Republicans and Republican leaners .
Increased cooperation with other countries is generally supported in both nations . In a Körber-Stiftung-sponsored survey fielded in Germany just before federal elections , people were asked whether Germany should cooperate more or less with various powers also included in Pew Research Center 's survey . Majorities said their country should cooperate more with each of these powers , but there were large variations in the strength of the responses . For example , nine-in-ten in Germany said the country should cooperate more with France . But only 56 % of Germans wanted to cooperate more with the U.S. , while about a third would cooperate less ( 34 % ) . When the Center asked the same question of Americans in October , majorities in the U.S. also said their country should cooperate more with Great Britain , France , Germany and China . But only 43 % of people in the U.S. say their country should cooperate more with Russia , while 44 % would cooperate less with the Kremlin . This is in stark contrast to opinion in Germany , where 78 % want to cooperate more with Moscow .
When asked about the information that advertisers can gather about their child 's online behavior , parents ' concern levels rival and sometimes even exceed worries about their child 's interaction with people they do not know online . In a 2012 survey 81 % of parents said they were `` very '' or `` somewhat '' concerned about how much information advertisers can learn about their child 's online behavior . By comparison , the combined levels of parental concern regarding their children 's interactions with people they do not know amounts to 72 % of all parents .
This chart shows several measures of age composition for families and compares those families headed by unauthorized migrants with those headed by legal immigrants and natives . The general conclusion of these comparisons is that , by almost any measure , unauthorized families are much younger , on the whole than either native families or families of legal immigrants . A much higher share of persons in unauthorized families are children ( under 18 ) —35 % among unauthorized families versus 29 % among legal immigrant families and only 24 % among native families . At the other end of the age spectrum , virtually none of the unauthorized population is elderly ( 65 and over ) . In contrast , about 1 in 6 native adults and the same share of legal immigrant adults is aged 65 or older . Among working-age ( 18 - 64 ) adults , the unauthorized population is also substantially younger . Almost all ( 84 % ) of unauthorized migrants in this age range are under age 45 . In contrast , only about three-fifths of native and legal immigrants of working age are under 45 .
In the wake of the 2016 presidential campaign , Facebook users were more likely to press the `` anger '' button than the `` love '' button in response to lawmakers ' posts on the platform . But a new Pew Research Center analysis finds that this trend has shifted in recent years , and that lawmakers received more love than anger reactions to their posts in 2019 and 2020 . In both 2017 and 2018 , Facebook posts by members of Congress received around 5 million more `` angry '' reactions than `` love '' reactions . But love reactions overtook anger in 2019 , and lawmakers have received roughly 2 million more love than anger reactions in the first seven months of 2020 .
Americans rank math as one of the most important skills children need today to get ahead . In a 2014 Pew Research Center survey , respondents were asked , `` Regardless of whether or not you think these skills are good to have , which ones do you think are most important for children to get ahead in the world today ? '' Roughly eight-in-ten U.S. adults ( 79 % ) said math is one of the most important skills needed for youth to get ahead . That placed math on par with teamwork , but slightly lower than communication and reading .
In addition to economic tumult and challenges regarding immigration , the past decade has also seen shifts in the stature of European nations on the world stage . This is particularly true of Germany . Across the 10 European nations polled , a median of 47 % say Germany plays a more important role than a decade ago , while 36 % believe it plays as important a role and just 15 % think it is less important . Only 25 % think France plays a more important role , while a roughly equal share say it is actually less important . As it struggles with the ramifications of its Brexit vote , the UK fares the worst among the three nations tested : 38 % believe the UK is less important than it was 10 years ago , while only 21 % think it is more important . ( For more on what people around the world think about the trajectory of major powers , see `` Trump 's International Ratings Remain Low , Especially Among Key Allies . '' )
The quits rate — the number people who voluntarily leave their jobs as a percentage of total employment — has improved somewhat from its 2009 - 10 lows , but at 1.7 % is still well below pre-recession levels ( typically 2 % or higher ) . The quits rate is a good indicator of labor-market confidence , since people are more willing to leave their jobs when they 're confident they can find a better one .
Discussions about having kids often focus on women 's desires and concerns . But the survey found that about half of men ages 15 to 44 who do n't have kids express at least some concern about going through life without the experience of being a father . By comparison , almost seven-in-ten childless women say the same .
Attitudes toward Iran are mostly negative worldwide . In 29 of 40 countries , a majority or plurality say they have an unfavorable opinion of the Islamic Republic . The only nations in which at least half express a favorable view are Bangladesh ( 63 % ) , Pakistan ( 63 % ) and Indonesia ( 51 % ) .
Republicans see benefits – as well as costs – from legalization . Our June survey found that a large majority of Republicans ( 70 % ) think it would be better for the U.S. economy if undocumented immigrants became legal workers . About as many ( 69 % ) said undocumented immigrants are `` hard workers who should have an opportunity to stay '' in the United States . '' And fully 76 % say it would be unrealistic to deport everyone in the country illegally . Yet substantial percentages of Republicans also see potential downsides from granting undocumented immigrants legal status : 77 % say it would encourage more people to come to the U.S. illegally and 68 % think it would reward illegal behavior . Most also say legalization would drain government services ( 68 % ) and cost U.S. jobs ( 66 % ) .
Both types of digital banking are on the rise . In 2010 , 46 % of U.S. adults , or 58 % of internet users , said they bank online . In 2011 , 18 % of cell phone owners said they have used their phone to check their balance or transact business with a bank .
Partisans ' views of individual congressional leaders are deeply divided . Republicans and Republican leaners have much more favorable views of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan than do Democrats and Democratic leaners , and the reverse is true for Minority Leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi . Schumer is not very well known , even among Democrats : 37 % view him favorably , 26 % unfavorably , while 36 % have no opinion .
This new approach gave us tremendous flexibility . Not only did we find out how people report race , we could see how many Americans marked only one race for themselves but had a mixed-race background when their parents ' or grandparents ' racial makeup was considered . We also could see in which generation a different race or races appeared in the family tree , and how multiracial identity persists or fades over the generations . We had discovered in some of our early survey tests that most mixed-race adults did not consider themselves to be multiracial . We wanted to understand this response , so in the final survey we asked this group why they did not consider themselves to be multiracial .
When asked if they received too many , not enough or just about the right amount of messages on dating sites or apps , 43 % of Americans who online dated in the past five years say they did not receive enough messages , while 17 % say they received too many messages . Another 40 % think the amount of messages they received was just about right . There are substantial gender differences in the amount of attention online daters say they received on dating sites or apps . Men who have online dated in the past five years are far more likely than women to feel as if they did not get enough messages ( 57 % vs. 24 % ) . On the other hand , women who have online dated in this time period are five times as likely as men to think they were sent too many messages ( 30 % vs. 6 % ) .
The public continues to support U.S. drone strikes targeting extremists in Pakistan and elsewhere , despite ongoing concerns that drone attacks endanger lives of innocent civilians . The national survey by the Pew Research Center , conducted May 12 - 18 among 2,002 adults , finds that 58 % approve of the U.S. conducting missile strikes from drones to target extremists in such countries as Pakistan , Yemen and Somalia . About a third ( 35 % ) disapprove of U.S. drone attacks . Public opinion about U.S. drone strikes has changed only modestly since February 2013 , when 56 % approved and 26 % disapproved of drone attacks . Support for drone strikes crosses party lines , though Republicans ( 74 % ) are more likely than independents ( 56 % ) or Democrats ( 52 % ) to favor the use of drones to target extremists .
Might 2016 be the year we break the fever ? So far it 's not looking that way . The public remains in a foul mood , frustrated by stagnant incomes , a shrinking middle class and gruesome global terrorism . Just 19 % say they trust the government to do what 's right . Moreover , most Republicans and many Democrats say they believe that , on the issues that matter most to them , the other side is winning . And not since the early 2000s has a majority of the public said the nation is on the right track , making these past dozen years the longest sustained stretch of national pessimism since the onset of polling .
While the Supreme Court has ruled that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits school-sponsored prayer in public schools , the court also has made clear that individual students have a right to pray in public settings . And , according to a new Pew Research Center survey of teens ages 13 to 17 , a sizable share of students in public school are availing themselves of this right . About a quarter of teens who identify with a religion and attend public school ( 26 % ) say they regularly pray before eating lunch at school . There are differences across religious groups , with 39 % of evangelical Protestant teens , 18 % of Catholic teens and 11 % of mainline Protestant teens saying they often or sometimes pray before eating lunch . ( The survey 's sample size was not large enough to report on the practices of teens who belong to most other religious groups . )
The world is aging . The demographic future for the U.S. and the world looks very different than the recent past . Growth from 1950 to 2010 was rapid — the global population nearly tripled , and the U.S. population doubled . However , population growth from 2010 to 2050 is projected to be significantly slower and is expected to tilt strongly to the oldest age groups , both globally and in the U.S. Public opinion on whether the growing number of older people is a problem varies dramatically around the world . Concern is highest in East Asia where large majorities describe aging as a major problem for their countries .
There is limited enthusiasm for most of the Muslim political figures tested on the survey , with the exception of Saudi King Abdullah , who is easily the most popular . In Jordan ( 92 % ) and Egypt ( 83 % ) for example , large majorities say they have confidence that King Abdullah will do the right thing in world affairs . The king receives quite positive ratings outside the Middle East as well , especially in the largely Muslim Asian nations Pakistan ( 64 % ) and Indonesia ( 61 % ) . However , the Saudi monarch does not receive high marks everywhere — only 8 % of Turks voice confidence in him . And overall his ratings are less positive than they were in 2007 . Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah receives less positive reviews . Only 37 % of Lebanese overall express confidence in Nasrallah ; however , the country 's Shia community shows almost unanimous confidence in him ( 97 % ) . He also receives relative high marks in the Palestinian territories , and especially in the West Bank , where 71 % say they think he will do the right thing in international affairs . Even before their disputed elections last year , both Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were generally unpopular among most of the Muslim publics surveyed . Ahmadinejad 's highest ratings are in the Palestinian territories ( 45 % confidence ) and Indonesia ( 43 % ) , although even among these publics fewer than half express a positive view of his leadership . There is no country in which even 40 % express confidence in Karzai , and in Pakistan ( 10 % ) , Turkey ( 7 % ) and Lebanon ( 7 % ) one-in-ten or fewer hold this view .
In the current survey , a larger majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 75 % ) than Republicans and Republican leaners ( 67 % ) say cyberattacks from other countries are a major threat to the U.S . In April 2016 , partisan views were the reverse : 78 % of Republicans viewed cyberattacks as a major threat compared with 68 % of Democrats .
Education is even more strongly associated with researching a new congregation – perhaps because people generally learn more research skills the longer they stay in school . For example , 71 % of college graduates talked to church members before choosing a new congregation , compared with 63 % among those with a high school degree or less .
The U.S. survey did not ask about banks and financial institutions , specifically . But it found that just 45 % of American adults had confidence in business leaders to work in the best interests of the public .
Europeans ' views of the EU remain generally positive after a sharp increase in 2017 . Across the 10 European states surveyed , a median of 62 % hold a favorable view of the institution . Ratings of the EU are highest in Poland and Spain , where roughly seven-in-ten have favorable views . About six-in-ten see the EU positively in Germany , the Netherlands , Sweden , France , Italy and Hungary . The UK and Greece , however , do not hold such favorable attitudes . In the UK , opinion is roughly split ; 48 % have a favorable opinion of the EU while 45 % have an unfavorable one . And in Greece , only 37 % have a positive opinion of the institution .
In its geopolitical rivalry with China , U.S. efforts to `` pivot '' to Asia – both economically and militarily – have general public support on both sides of the Pacific . Roughly half or more of the publics in seven of the nine nations surveyed that are involved in negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) trade and investment treaty , which is being pushed by the Obama administration , say such an accord would be good for their countries , though Americans are among the least supportive . Majorities or pluralities in five of eight TPP countries say it 's more important to have strong economic ties with the U.S. than China .
However , they also believe their country is facing a variety of challenges . In particular , corruption – which has been a major focus of President Xi Jinping – remains a serious concern . Fully 84 % say corrupt officials are a big problem , and 44 % think they are a very big problem .
Women are more likely than men to say that masks should always be worn in public places ( 53 % vs. 42 % ) . White people are substantially less likely than black and Hispanic adults to say that masks should always be worn . Age is also strongly related to views about mask wearing . About four-in-ten ( 42 % ) of those ages 18 to 29 say that masks should always be worn , compared with 55 % of those 65 and older .
For example , e-reader device ownership has fallen . Today , about one-in-five adults ( 19 % ) report owning an e-reader , while in early 2014 that share was a third ( 32 % ) . Ownership of MP3 players has not had a notable decline , but the percentage of adults who own one has hovered around the 40 % mark since 2008 . And computer ownership levels have stayed roughly where they were a decade ago . These changes are all taking place in a world where smartphones are transforming into all-purpose devices that can take the place of specialized technology , such as music players , e-book readers and gaming devices . Some of the changes in device ownership patterns are particularly evident for young adults . Among those ages 18 - 29 , ownership of MP3 players and computers has declined by double digits in the past five years . In 2010 , three-quarters of 18- to 29-year-olds owned an MP3 player ; by 2015 , only half ( 51 % ) had one . Cellphones continue to top of the list . Roughly nine-in-ten American adults ( 92 % ) own a mobile phone of some kind . Although these mobile devices are ubiquitous today , the share of adults who own one has risen substantially since 2004 , when Pew Research conducted its first poll on cell ownership . At that time , 65 % of Americans owned a cellphone .
Six-in-ten or more Indonesians say they are likely to take political action on a range of issues , but most say they have never actually participated in civic activities . About two-thirds ( 66 % ) said they would take action such as contacting an election official or participating in demonstrations when it comes to poor quality schools or health care . Roughly as many ( 65 % ) said they would do so if the issue was poverty , and 62 % said they would engage in political activity in support of freedom of speech .
The survey finds that 52 % of Americans now view the nation 's highest court favorably , while 38 % have an unfavorable opinion . Ratings of the court have edged lower since April ( from 56 % favorable ) .
When it comes to public opinion , Americans generally have a favorable view of unions and believe that the long-term decline in their membership has been more of a bad thing than a good thing . A 55 % majority of U.S. adults said earlier this year that they view labor unions favorably , compared with a third who viewed them unfavorably . These views have fluctuated over the past two decades , but are now more positive than they were during the Great Recession . In the same survey , around half of Americans ( 51 % ) said the reduction in union representation over the past 20 years has been mostly bad for working people , while around a third ( 35 % ) said it has been mostly good .
Majority sees increased partisan divisions , but fewer do so than last fall . The public has long believed that the nation 's partisan divisions have widened . But the share saying divisions between Republicans and Democrats , while large , has declined since last September . Currently , 65 % say divisions between Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. are growing , compared with 78 % who said this last fall .
The sharing economy and on-demand services are starting to weave their way into the lives of Americans . About seven-in-ten Americans ( 72 % ) have used some type of online or shared service , such as the ride-hailing service Uber or the home-sharing service Airbnb . College graduates , those with relatively high household incomes and those younger than 45 are most exposed to these services . Those with lower incomes and who live in rural areas are less exposed .
A survey conducted in early May after the Senate rejected a measure to expand background checks on private gun sales found that gun rights advocates continue to show a higher level of political activism on the issue than those who favor stricter gun control measures . Among those who prioritize gun rights , 41 % say they would not vote for a candidate with whom they disagreed on gun policy , even if they agreed with the candidate on most other issues . That figure is 10 percentage points higher than the number of gun control supporters ( 31 % ) who say gun policy is a make-or-break voting issue for them . And while nearly as many gun control supporters as gun rights supporters report contacting a public official about gun policy in the past six months , more gun rights advocates have contributed money to organizations that take positions on gun policy ( 12 % vs. 3 % of gun control supporters ) .
Even as publics in many of the surveyed countries express a clear preference for women to dress conservatively , many also say women should be able to decide for themselves what to wear . This attitude is most prevalent in Tunisia ( 56 % ) , Turkey ( 52 % ) and Lebanon ( 49 % ) – all countries where substantial percentages are open to women not covering their heads in public . But nearly as many in Saudi Arabia ( 47 % ) also say a women should be free to choose how she dresses . Smaller , but sizable percentages agree in Iraq ( 27 % ) , Pakistan ( 22 % ) and Egypt ( 14 % ) . What the survey leaves unanswered is whether respondents think social or cultural norms will guide women in their choice to wear more conservative or less conservative attire in public .
As Americans have become more negative on China , they have also become more downbeat about their country 's global stature . In 2016 , a 46 % plurality of Americans said the U.S. plays a less important and powerful role as a world leader compared with 10 years ago . This figure was up 26 percentage points from 2004 , when just 20 % believed American power was waning . The Chinese public , on the other hand , sees its country 's influence on the rise . Three-quarters of Chinese believe their country is playing a more important role in the world today compared with a decade ago .
More broadly , in a 2014 survey we asked online Indians what types of activities they use the internet for . Majorities of internet users said they had used the web to stay in touch with family and friends and to search and apply for jobs in the past 12 months . At the time , fewer than a quarter of online Indians said they were engaging in commerce or taking a class , but roughly a third or more were getting information about health , government services or politics online . Indians do n't necessarily see the increasing influence of the internet in India as a good thing for the country . In a 2014 survey , only 31 % of Indians said that the increasing use of the internet has had a good influence on politics , 32 % said it was good for personal relationships and 37 % said it was good for morality . Views of the internet 's influence on education were more positive , though : 57 % of Indians say it has been good for education in their country .
The destinations of emigrants from Latin American and Caribbean countries have changed somewhat since 1990 , though the United States remains the overwhelming destination of choice . The U.S. was home to 67 % of the region 's emigrants in 2017 , almost unchanged from 62 % in 1990 . In 2017 , 16 % of emigrants lived in other Latin American-Caribbean countries , down from 26 % in 1990 . Argentina was the top destination country for this group of emigrants , with 1.8 million people from other Latin American countries living there in 2017 , up from 830,000 in 1990 . Meanwhile , the share of Latin American and Caribbean emigrants living in Europe reached 12 % in 2017 , up from 7 % in 1990 .
Half of Americans say they think China will have less influence in world affairs after the coronavirus outbreak than it did before – more than twice as many as expect its influence to grow ( 17 % ) following the crisis ( 31 % expect no real change ) . In comparison , a plurality of Americans expect their own country 's influence to remain largely unchanged ( 41 % ) , while roughly three-in-ten each say U.S. influence will increase ( 29 % ) or decrease ( 29 % ) .
The vast majority of Americans – 96 % – now own a cellphone of some kind . The share of Americans that own smartphones is now 81 % , up from just 35 % in Pew Research Center 's first survey of smartphone ownership conducted in 2011 . Along with mobile phones , Americans own a range of other information devices . Nearly three-quarters of U.S. adults now own desktop or laptop computers , while roughly half now own tablet computers and roughly half own e-reader devices .
Homeowners point to a variety of reasons for considering solar panels . A large majority of homeowners who have already installed or have given serious thought to installing solar panels say they want to help the environment ( 87 % ) . And almost all ( 96 % ) say they want to save money on utility bills . A recent report also found that installing solar panels can increase a home 's value .
The Latin America and Caribbean region is expected to have the oldest population of any world region by 2100 , a reversal from the 20th century . In 1950 , the region 's median age was just 20 years . That figure is projected to more than double to 49 years by 2100 .
Voters approached the 2018 midterm elections with some trepidation about the voting process and many had concerns that U.S. election systems may be hacked . After the election , however , most say it was `` very easy '' to vote and confidence in election security has increased . About three-quarters of those who report casting ballots in the midterm elections ( 76 % ) say that voting was `` very easy . '' In a survey conducted in October , just 44 % of those who planned to vote expected that the process would be very easy .
Our analysis found that , in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington and Houston metros , 37 % of low-income households ( those that take in less than 67 % of the metro area 's median annual household income , for example less than $ 38,000 in Dallas ) are located in census tracts in which at least half of households are low-income . Residential concentration among upper-income households ( defined as making at least 200 % of the metro area 's median household income , for example at least $ 113,000 in Dallas ) is also high in Texas . Houston and Dallas topped the charts among the 10 largest metropolitan areas , with 24 % and 23 % , respectively , of upper-income households lying in census tracts that were at least half upper-income . Of the 306 majority lower-income census tracts in the Dallas-Fort Worth area , 83 % are predominantly non-white . Meanwhile , 95 % of the 108 majority upper-income tracts are predominantly non-Hispanic white . Majority middle- and mixed-income tracts that are predominantly non-Hispanic white account for 52 % of the Dallas metropolitan tracts , located mostly in suburban areas .
Among the public overall , 15 % say they have attended a political event , rally or protest since the election – with two-thirds ( 67 % ) of this group saying they have done so to oppose Trump or his policies .
After peaking in 2011 , the number of federal criminal prosecutions has declined for five consecutive years and is now at its lowest level in nearly two decades , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the federal court system . The decline comes as Attorney General Jeff Sessions has indicated that the Justice Department will reverse the trend and ramp up criminal prosecutions in the years ahead . Federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against 77,152 defendants in fiscal year 2016 , according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts . That 's a decline of 25 % since fiscal 2011 , when 102,617 defendants were charged , and marks the lowest yearly total since 1997 . The data count all defendants charged in U.S. district courts with felonies and serious misdemeanors , as well as some defendants charged with petty offenses . They exclude defendants whose cases were handled by magistrate judges . Prosecutions for drug , immigration and property offenses – the three most common categories of crime charged by the federal government – all have declined over the past five years . The Justice Department filed drug charges against 24,638 defendants in 2016 , down 23 % from 2011 . It filed immigration charges against 20,762 defendants , down 26 % . And it charged 10,712 people with property offenses such as fraud and embezzlement , a 39 % decline .
The public 's views of current economic conditions also remain negative . Just 9 % say conditions are excellent or good , which is little changed from measures over the past two years . However , among those viewing the economy negatively – as only fair or poor – the proportion rating it poor has declined over the past few months while the percentage saying it is only fair has risen .
As part of the July survey , the Center asked social media users who say they have changed their views about a political or social issue because of something they saw to describe a recent instance when this took place . Some 12 % of these adults say they changed their views – either positively or negatively – about the Black Lives Matter movement or about police brutality and the need for police reform . ( The responses below are lightly edited for spelling , style and readability . )
Government and politics seen as working better locally than nationally . Far more Americans have a favorable opinion of their local government ( 67 % ) than of the federal government ( 35 % ) . In addition , there is substantial satisfaction with the quality of candidates running for Congress and local elections in recent elections . That stands in contrast with views of the recent presidential candidates ; just 41 % say the quality of presidential candidates in recent elections has been good .
Majorities also oppose reducing military defense spending ( 56 % ) and funding for scientific research ( 54 % ) . Opinion is divided over reducing funding to help low-income Americans ( 50 % disapprove vs. 43 % approve ) . There also is resistance to making changes in Social Security and Medicare to reduce the debt and deficit : 57 % oppose raising the amount Medicare recipients contribute to their health care , while 56 % disapprove of gradually raising the Social Security retirement age . About as many disapprove ( 47 % ) as approve ( 49 % ) of reducing Medicare benefits for higher-income seniors .
In the eight Western European publics surveyed , a median of just 22 % say belief in God is necessary to be moral , while in the six Eastern European nations studied , a median of 33 % share the same view . Prior research establishes the European continent as increasingly secular on the whole , though among Europeans , there are notable differences between Eastern and Western countries in attitudes toward religion and religious minorities . Less than half in both Canada and the U.S. say belief in God is necessary to be moral ( 26 % and 44 % , respectively ) . ( For more on religion in the U.S. , go to `` In a Politically Polarized Era , Sharp Divides in Both Partisan Coalitions . '' ) By contrast , nearly everyone surveyed in Indonesia and the Philippines ( 96 % each ) draws a connection between belief in God and having good values . And nearly eight-in-ten ( 79 % ) in India say the same . But in East Asia , South Koreans are somewhat split on this question ( 53 % say it is necessary , 46 % say it is not ) , while smaller shares in Japan ( 39 % ) and Australia ( 19 % ) take the view that it 's necessary to believe in God to be a moral person .
Overall , 41 % favored the increased use of fracking to extract oil and natural gas from underground rock formations while 47 % are opposed , according to last November 's poll . In March 2013 , there was more support ( 48 % ) than opposition ( 38 % ) to increased use of the drilling technique . Republicans support increased fracking far more than Democrats , by a 62 % to 29 % margin . There was a particularly dramatic change of views in the Midwest where increased use of fracking is now opposed by a 47 % to 39 % margin compared with the majority who favored its use in 2013 . In broad terms , developing alternative energy is viewed ( by 60 % to 30 % ) as a more important priority than expanding the exploration and production of oil , coal and natural gas , according to a December 2014 survey . Yet when asked about specific policies to address the energy supply , a majority of Americans continue to support allowing more offshore oil and gas drilling in U.S. waters ( 56 % ) and more mining and drilling on federally owned land ( 58 % ) — opinions largely unchanged from previous years . About eight-in-ten ( 81 % ) Americans support requirements for better fuel efficiency for cars and trucks .
Similarly , impressions of news about gas prices remain more negative than positive ( 44 % bad news , 32 % mixed news , 15 % good news ) . These ratings also are somewhat worse than they were in February .
Among the nation 's 10.4 million unauthorized adults , a shrinking share have been in the country for less than five years—15 % in 2012 , compared with 38 % in 2000 . A rising share have lived in the U.S. for a decade or more—62 % in 2012 , compared with 35 % in 2000 . About a fifth ( 21 % ) had been in the U.S. for two decades or more as of 2012 .
Republicans and Democrats have similar levels of understanding about science , in contrast to the wide differences by education and racial and ethnic group . Republicans and independents who lean to the Republican Party average seven correct answers , while Democrats and independents who lean to the Democratic Party average 6.6 . Those at the ends of the political spectrum – liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans – score higher than those in the middle , however . On average , liberal Democrats get 7.8 correct answers and conservative Republicans score 7.4 . In comparison , moderate and liberal Republicans get an average of 6.5 correct answers , while moderate and conservative Democrats get an average of 5.6 .
Iran is not only the world 's fifth-biggest petroleum producer ( about 4.1 million barrels a day ) and 12th-biggest exporter ( 1.3 million barrels a day ) , it also has the world 's fourth-largest stock of proven crude oil reserves : 158.4 billion barrels , trailing only Venezuela , Saudi Arabia and Canada . Despite its oil wealth , Iran 's economy has been turbulent for much of the past decade . It 's real ( inflation-adjusted ) gross domestic product fell in three of the four years from 2012 to 2015 , grew by 12.5 % in 2016 and is projected to have fallen back dramatically since then .
Although he has only been in office a few months , Donald Trump 's presidency has had a major impact on how the world sees the United States . Trump and many of his key policies are broadly unpopular around the globe , and ratings for the U.S. have declined steeply in many nations . According to a new Pew Research Center survey spanning 37 nations , a median of just 22 % has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs . This stands in contrast to the final years of Barack Obama 's presidency , when a median of 64 % expressed confidence in Trump 's predecessor to direct America 's role in the world . The sharp decline in how much global publics trust the U.S. president on the world stage is especially pronounced among some of America 's closest allies in Europe and Asia , as well as neighboring Mexico and Canada . Across the 37 nations polled , Trump gets higher marks than Obama in only two countries : Russia and Israel . In countries where confidence in the U.S. president fell most , America 's overall image has also tended to suffer more . In the closing years of the Obama presidency , a median of 64 % had a positive view of the U.S. Today , just 49 % are favorably inclined toward America . Again , some of the steepest declines in U.S. image are found among long-standing allies .
After rising steadily and substantially for several years , the growth in remittances sent to Mexico began slackening notably in mid-2006 and the rate of growth slowed through the first quarter of 2007 . From the beginning of 2003 through the middle of 2006 , remittance receipts showed annual increases averaging 26.5 % , measured on a quarterly basis . Since mid-2006 , the rate of annual growth has averaged 6.5 % ; in the first quarter of 2007 it was 3.4 % .
Tablet computer and smartphone ownership have each increased dramatically in recent years , and a growing share of Americans are using these multipurpose mobile devices – rather than dedicated e-readers – to read books . Between 2011 and 2016 , the number of Americans who read books on tablet computers has increased nearly fourfold ( from 4 % to 15 % ) , while the share who read books on smartphones has more than doubled ( from 5 % to 13 % ) . The share of Americans who read books on desktop or laptop computers has also increased , although by a more modest amount : 11 % of Americans now do this , up from 7 % in 2011 .
The Pew Research Center 's results generally track with the General Social Survey : When the GSS asked last year if people had a gun in their home or garage , 34 % said they did .
Minorities of people express strong trust in scientists ' understanding of the causes of climate change ( 28 % ) or the health effects of eating GM foods ( 19 % ) , saying that scientists understand these matters `` very well . '' About half of people ( 47 % ) say the same about medical scientists ' understanding of the health effects of the MMR vaccine . At least four in 10 people say that scientists understand each of these matters `` fairly well . '' A sizable share of people are skeptical of climate scientists ' and GM food scientists ' understanding about the causes of climate change and the health effects of GM foods , respectively , saying that scientists understand these matters `` not too well '' or `` not at all well . ''
A year after the death of its leader , al Qaeda is widely unpopular among Muslim publics . A new poll by the Pew Research Center 's Global Attitudes Project , conducted March 19 to April 13 , 2012 , finds majorities – and mostly large majorities – expressing negative views of the terrorist group in Egypt , Jordan , Pakistan , Turkey and Lebanon . In Pakistan , where Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. Navy Seals , 13 % of Muslims hold a favorable view of al Qaeda , 55 % an unfavorable view , and roughly three-in-ten ( 31 % ) offer no opinion . Support for the organization is in the single digits among Turkish and Lebanese Muslims . In Jordan , just 15 % express a positive opinion , essentially unchanged from last year , but down significantly from 34 % in 2010 . Al Qaeda receives its highest ratings in Egypt , where 21 % hold a favorable and 71 % an unfavorable opinion .
During 2014 and 2015 , when construction of the railway was in progress , an average of 62 % of Nigerians living within 150 kilometers ( 93 miles ) of the project expressed a positive view toward China . That share increased to an average of 71 % across the four years after the project 's completion in 2016 .
While support for offshore drilling has largely rebounded , many Americans also support investments in alternative energy . By a two-to-one ratio , a greater share of the public favors developing alternatives like wind , solar and hydrogen over expanding ventures into oil , coal and natural gas ( 60 % vs. 30 % ) . In fact , the public takes something of an all-of-the-above approach to energy : 81 % support better fuel-efficiency requirements and 58 % want more mining and drilling on federal land . An additional 41 % would favor the government promoting the increased use of nuclear power .
This pattern is different from that of Latinos in other parts of the country . For example , in California , the state with the largest Hispanic population , 30 % say they prefer `` Hispanic '' and 17 % say they prefer the term `` Latino . '' In Florida , results are similar—31 % prefer `` Hispanic '' and 17 % prefer `` Latino . '' The pattern for New York and all other states is nearly the same .
Observers expect Hungarians to deliver a resounding `` no '' to accepting EU-mandated refugee quotas in a referendum Sunday . Through the course of a highly controversial campaign , Orbán has been criticized for referring to refugees as `` poison '' and supporting campaign ads linking refugees to terrorism . Such controversy has exacerbated tensions within the EU on Hungary 's adherence to European values of pluralism and liberal democracy . Despite the country 's labor shortage , Hungarians overwhelmingly see refugees as an economic albatross , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted this spring . Roughly eight-in-ten believe refugees are a burden on their country because they take jobs and social benefits . Similarly , about three-quarters believe that refugees will increase the likelihood of terrorism in Hungary , and about seven-in-ten see the large influx of refugees from countries like Syria and Iraq as a major threat . These figures are much higher in Hungary than in almost every other EU nation surveyed .
The Census Bureau statistics indicate that demographic change is percolating upward through the nation 's age groups , starting with the youngest ones . In fact , the bureau estimates indicate that 50.3 % of children younger than 5 were racial or ethnic minorities in 2015 .
While all community types gained at least some population from international migration , suburban counties stand out in terms of domestic migration . A net of 6.4 million people have moved from urban and rural areas into the suburbs since 2000 ( meaning that 6.4 million more people moved into suburban areas from an urban or rural area than moved out of suburban areas to different types of communities ) , while cities lost a net of 5.4 million people and rural counties lost 1.0 million people to other community types . Combined with international migration , urban counties gained a net total of only 1.6 million people due to migration and rural counties lost about 400,000 , compared with suburban counties ' gain of 11.7 million people .
Plastic surgery has since expanded from treatments aimed mainly at repairing damage to include elective changes like liposuction or tummy tucks . While it 's now a multibillion-dollar industry , just 4 % of Americans say they have ever had elective cosmetic surgery , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in spring 2016 . Less invasive procedures like skin or lip injections are also rare ; just 2 % of U.S. adults report having had this done .
Though the health care debate dominated news interest and coverage last week , four-in-ten Americans ( 41 % ) say they followed news about the economy very closely and 13 % say they followed this news more closely than any other major story . Economic news made up 8 % of the coverage analyzed by PEJ . Just more than one-in-ten ( 12 % ) say they very closely followed news about drug-related violence in Mexico , while 5 % say this was the story they followed most closely . These stories made up 2 % of coverage . Fewer than one-in-ten ( 8 % ) say they very closely followed reports about the Vatican 's handling of sex-abuse scandals in the Catholic Church . Just 1 % say this was the story they followed most closely . These stories accounted for 1 % of coverage .
The percentage of Americans who say they think Congress will pass health care legislation this year edged up to 43 % , but about half ( 49 % ) still say lawmakers will not pass a bill in 2010 .
Seven-in-ten blacks said blacks were treated less fairly in dealings with the police , versus 37 % of whites who said so ; almost as many blacks ( 68 % ) said blacks were treated less fairly in the courts . About half ( 54 % ) of blacks , versus 16 % of whites , said blacks were treated less fairly at the workplace , a share that 's been rising since the late 1990s . And just over half ( 51 % ) of blacks , compared with 15 % of whites , said their local public schools treated blacks less fairly .
By 2005 ( the last year for which figures are available ) , naturalized citizens accounted for slightly more than one-in-two ( 52 % ) legal foreign-born residents . Among all 36 million foreign-born residents in 2005 , naturalized citizens made up a slim plurality ( 35 % ) over legal non-citizens ( 33 % ) and unauthorized migrants ( 31 % ) . In 1995 , legal non-citizens had accounted for a near majority ( 47 % ) of the 24 million foreign-born residents who were in the country at the time , compared with 30 % who were naturalized citizens and 20 % who were unauthorized migrants . While the number of legal permanent residents admitted to the U.S. has risen in recent years , the number of naturalized citizens has grown even more rapidly ( Appendix Table 2 ) . In fact , because so many new immigrants have become citizens , the size of the legal non-citizen population has barely grown since the mid-1990s .
Opinions are also divided along racial and ethnic lines . The largest share of White adults ( 49 % ) say the protests have drawn too much attention from news organizations , while around a third ( 34 % ) say they 've gotten the right amount of attention and 17 % say they 've gotten too little . Black adults overwhelmingly say the protests have drawn either the right amount of attention ( 45 % ) or not enough ( 42 % ) ; just 13 % believe they have received too little attention . Majorities of Hispanic and Asian Americans also say the protests have received the right amount of attention or not enough .
Majority of voters are confident election systems are secure from technological threats . Overall , 56 % of voters say they are very or somewhat confident that election systems in the U.S. are secure from hacking and other technological threats . That is higher than the share of voters who said this two years ago ( 47 % ) . Democratic voters , in particular , have become more confident ; the share of Biden supporters who are confident election systems are secure from technological threats is 19 percentage points higher today when compared with supporters of Democratic congressional candidates in the 2018 midterms ( 53 % now , 34 % then ) . There has been less change among those backing GOP candidates in 2018 and Trump supporters today ( 60 % now , 65 % then ) .
Democrats are more likely than Republicans to see the coronavirus in the most serious terms . As of last week , nearly eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 78 % ) say the outbreak is a major threat to the health of the U.S. population as a whole ; a much smaller share of Republicans and GOP leaners ( 52 % ) say the same . Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say the coronavirus outbreak presents a major threat to the U.S. economy , their personal finances and their own health .
In a 2017 Pew Research Center survey of seven Latin American countries , a median of 47 % said they have a favorable view of the U.S. Approval was highest in the summit 's host country , Peru ( 51 % ) , as well as in Colombia ( 51 % ) and Brazil ( 50 % ) . The U.S. received the least positive ratings in Mexico , where just 30 % said they have a favorable view .
However , when it comes to concerns about North Korea 's nuclear arsenal , there is a slight partisan difference . Roughly three-quarters of Republicans ( 74 % ) are very concerned about the weapons program , compared with 66 % of Democrats . There is a larger division by age on concern about the North 's nukes . Nearly eight-in-ten Americans ages 50 and older ( 78 % ) say they are very concerned about North Korea having nuclear weapons , compared with only 42 % of 18- to 29-year-olds .
Overall , religiously unaffiliated people are more concentrated among young adults than other age groups – 35 % of Millennials ( those born 1981 - 1996 ) are `` nones . '' In addition , the unaffiliated as a whole are getting even younger . The median age of unaffiliated adults is now 36 , down from 38 in 2007 and significantly younger than the overall median age of U.S. adults in 2014 ( 46 ) .
The Pew Research survey did not ask about children marrying without the consent of their parents , but did ask about ending a woman 's life if she engages in premarital sex or adultery . Four-in-ten respondents said that the practice was justified , including three-in-ten ( 30 % ) who said it was often justified and 9 % who said it was sometimes justified . About half said that ending a woman 's life to protect family honor was rarely ( 5 % ) or never ( 46 % ) justified .
Overall , 44 % of Americans now say that it is a lot more difficult to be a Black person in the U.S. than it is to be a White person , while 32 % say it is a little more difficult and 23 % say it is no more difficult . The share saying it is a lot more difficult to be Black than White is now 9 percentage points higher than it was in the summer of 2016 . But while overall views have shifted , the shift has come exclusively from within the Democratic coalition . The attitudes of Trump supporters today look very similar to attitudes of Trump supporters four years ago : 45 % of Trump voters now say that it is no more difficult to be a Black person in the U.S. than to be a White person , while 44 % say Black people have it a little more difficult . Only about one-in-ten Trump supporters say that Black people have it a lot more difficult than White people . But while overall views have shifted , the shift has come exclusively from within the Democratic coalition . The attitudes of Trump supporters today look very similar to attitudes of Trump supporters four years ago : 45 % of Trump voters now say that it is no more difficult to be a Black person in the U.S. than to be a White person , while 44 % say Black people have it a little more difficult . Only about one-in-ten Trump supporters say that Black people have it a lot more difficult than White people .
Overall , Americans ' views about whether the earth is warming have remained relatively stable in recent years , with about two-thirds of the public ( 68 % ) currently saying there is solid evidence that the average temperature on Earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades while 25 % say there is not solid evidence of this . Even so , a new Pew Research Center survey finds that there has been a significant uptick over the past two years in the share of Americans who say global warming is a very serious problem . Currently , 46 % say that global warming is a very serious problem , up 13 percentage points from the spring of 2013 .
Currently about half of Republicans ( 49 % ) say they are satisfied with the state of the nation . Though this is unchanged since February , it is up from 24 % in January and 11 % in late October , a few weeks before the 2016 election . Throughout the course of Barack Obama 's presidency , no more than about two-in-ten Republicans expressed satisfaction with the way things were going in the country . By contrast , Democrats ' satisfaction with the country has plummeted following the election : Just 16 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they are satisfied with the way things are going today . This is down from 33 % in January and 52 % in October .
More than one-quarter ( 28 % ) of Americans read books in both print and digital formats ( which includes e-books and audio books ) . Some 38 % read print books but did not read books in any digital formats , while just 6 % read digital books but not print books .
As has been the case for the last several years , Americans view Congress negatively : Just 22 % now express a favorable opinion of the institution while 71 % say their opinion is unfavorable . The current ratings rival the lowest on record ( in July 2013 , 21 % had a favorable opinion , 70 % an unfavorable one ) ; and are down six points since July of this year , though they are on-par with ratings in February .
The downturn did increase unemployment across the board . Among mothers , the share of the working-age population , ages 16 and older , that was not employed increased from 2.2 % in September 2019 to 4.7 % in September 2020 . Fathers saw a similar rise in the share not employed , from 1.7 % to 4.5 % . Among mothers , those with children ages 3 and older experienced a slightly greater decrease in the share employed and at work ; among fathers , the decrease in this share was greater among those with children younger than 3 . Reflecting the gender gap in childcare , mothers with children younger than 3 are less likely to be at work . In September 2020 , 53.9 % of these mothers were employed and at work , compared with 70.4 % of mothers whose youngest child was 14 to 17 years old . These shares have dropped since September 2019 for all groups of mothers , with the decrease among mothers with children ages 3 to 5 or ages 6 to 13 ( 6.7 percentage points each ) being greater than among other mothers . Among fathers with children younger than 3 , the share who were working fell from 91.9 % in September 2019 to 85.0 % in September 2020 . The decrease in workplace activity was more modest among fathers with older children . For example , among fathers with children ages 14 to 17 , the overall share who were at work fell from 87.5 % % in September 2019 to 85.1 % in September 2020 .
The decline in the share of Americans who cite television as their main source of national and international news crosses all age groups . Over the past three years , the number saying TV is their main source has fallen 16 points among 18 - 29 year-olds , eight points among those 30 to 49 , and six points among those age 50 and older .
Through much of this election cycle – especially in recent months – interest in campaign news has been comparable to interest in the 2008 race . Four years ago , the percentage following presidential election news very closely dipped following the early primary fights between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton but then ramped up sharply at the end of the summer as the parties met to nominate their candidates . Interest continued to rise until Election Day . Similarly in 2004 , interest in campaign news increased following the conventions . That year , the Democratic convention was held at the end of July and the GOP convention spanned the end of August and the start of September . In July , 29 % said they were following news about the presidential campaign very closely . That increased to 40 % in September , following the conventions that nominated George W. Bush and John Kerry .
According to a new Pew Research Center/USA TODAY survey , 71 % of Americans say undocumented immigrants who meet certain requirements should be allowed to stay in the country . And 77 % say any legislation allowing them to do so also should provide for increased security along the borders .
Indeed , most Americans assign different degrees of value to different pieces of information . Social Security numbers are ranked as the most sensitive information , while people 's purchasing habits ranked lowest as something they felt was very sensitive .
Democratic support for doing whatever is necessary to improve the position of minorities , including the possible use of preferences , has increased in recent years . About half ( 52 % ) of Democrats agree that `` We should make every effort to improve the position of blacks and other minorities , even if it means giving them preferential treatment '' – an 11-point increase since 2007 . Republicans ' views have changed little over this period . Just 12 % currently agree that all efforts should be taken , including the use of preferential treatment , to improve the position of minorities . Since 1987 , the gap between the two parties has about doubled – from 18 points to 40 points .
Of four possible options for cutting the deficit , only one – lowering domestic spending – draws majority support . Roughly six-in-ten ( 61 % ) are in favor of cutting domestic spending while just 30 % are opposed . The public is divided over lowering military spending ( 49 % favor vs. 47 % oppose ) to reduce the deficit .
Most unauthorized immigrants live with spouses , partners , their children or other relatives . In 2016 , 5.6 million children younger than 18 were living with unauthorized immigrant parents .5 Of these , 675,000 were unauthorized immigrants themselves , a number that has fallen by half since 2007 . The other 5 million children were born in the U.S. , a number that rose from 4.5 million in 2007 . The number of U.S.-born children leveled off in recent years as births to unauthorized immigrants have dipped and an increasing number of children of unauthorized immigrants have aged into adulthood .
Most voters who cast ballots in person say that their polling place was not too ( 28 % ) or not at all ( 41 % ) crowded . About three-in-ten say it was somewhat ( 24 % ) or very ( 6 % ) crowded .
In general , we found little evidence that cognitive processes of these sorts created mode differences in responses . That may reflect the fact that the questions chosen for this study are drawn from well-tested items designed for telephone surveys , and thus do not reflect the kinds of burdensome items that have previously been shown to create mode effects . It 's also possible that the panelists , having participated in one large telephone survey with Pew Research Center ( the polarization study that was used to recruit the American Trends Panel ) and – for the vast majority – at least one previous panel wave , are savvier survey participants than others and thus are less vulnerable to mode effects than a fresh cross-sectional sample would be . Responses to all but four of the 60 items showed at least some numerical difference by mode , and the median difference across all items was 5 percentage points . The largest difference was 18 points , and there were eight items with differences of at least 10 points . But most of the 24 non-zero differences smaller than 5 percentage points are not statistically significant , and thus could have occurred by chance as a result of sampling error .
And half of voters ( 50 % ) say `` experience and a proven record '' is more important to them than `` new ideas and a different approach '' ( 43 % ) . Republicans ( 59 % ) are more likely than either Democrats ( 46 % ) or independents ( 48 % ) to prioritize a proven record .
Only about half of the nation 's 60 million Hispanics are eligible to vote – the smallest share of any racial or ethnic group . While the Hispanic population has grown rapidly in recent decades , many are not eligible voters . More than other racial or ethnic groups , many Hispanics are young ( 18.6 million are under 18 years old ) or non-citizen adults ( 11.3 million , more than half of whom are unauthorized immigrants ) . The share of the Hispanic population that is eligible to vote varies greatly by state . About 71 % of Maine 's Hispanic population is eligible to vote , as is 68 % of Montana 's , the highest shares in the country . Among states with the largest Hispanic populations , about half or more of Hispanics are eligible to vote in Florida ( 56 % ) , California ( 51 % ) and Texas ( 50 % ) . The two states with the lowest shares of eligible voters among their Hispanic populations are North Carolina ( 34 % ) and Tennessee ( 33 % ) .
Sarobi , however , has reportedly received numerous death threats , and despite some visible gains for women 's rights – especially since the days of Taliban rule from 1996 - 2001 – surveys show mixed feelings among the Afghan public about women 's role in society . For example , there is a stark contrast between the share of Afghan women ( 60 % ) and men ( 35 % ) who support equal representation for men and women in elected government positions , according to a 2013 survey of Afghans conducted by The Asia Foundation . On one hand , 90 % of Afghans in that survey agreed that everyone should have equal rights under the law ( regardless of gender ) , and 83 % agreed that women should have the same opportunities as men in education – including a strong majority ( 78 % ) of Afghan men . ( The survey also found that 76 % of Afghan women have received no education , an area Sarobi cites as a key priority . ) But at the same time , a significant minority of Afghans ( 36 % ) said that women should not be allowed to work outside the home – a share that had grown from 27 % in 2006 . While 82 % of Afghan women said in 2013 that women should be allowed to work outside the home , just 51 % of men agreed .
That reflects the wider trend in U.S. society . According to Census figures , veterans currently make up about 7 % of the overall population , down from 13.7 % in 1970 — when the Vietnam War was raging and the draft was still in place . As a 2011 Pew Research Center report noted , the post-9/11 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been fought by a historically small U.S. military ; this has contributed to a distance between the military and civilian society . While Americans overwhelmingly say they feel proud of those who 've served and appreciate their sacrifices , 71 % say most Americans know little or nothing about the problems faced by military personnel ; about as many ( 74 % ) oppose reinstating a draft .
This analysis also illustrates how the site 's recommendation engine steers users toward progressively more popular content as measured by view counts . Collectively , the starting videos in this analysis had an average of just over 8 million views . But the first videos recommended by the algorithm were much more popular , with nearly 30 million views on average . And videos in the final step in these walks had an average of more than 40 million views . Although the magnitude of the effect is slightly different in each case , this general relationship held true regardless of whether the initial video was chosen based on date posted , view count , relevance or user rating . Even when starting on one of a channel 's five most recent videos ( which average fewer than 2 million views ) the recommendation algorithm consistently suggested more popular videos . By the fourth recommendation on walks starting from a channel 's most recent videos , viewers were recommended videos with an average of nearly 33 million views .
A Pew Research Center survey in May found that for the first time , more than half ( 51 % ) of Americans favored allowing gay men and lesbians to marry . The same survey found that 72 % percent of Americans believe that legal recognition of same-sex marriage is inevitable , regardless of whether they themselves favor or oppose it : While 85 % of same-sex marriage supporters say legal recognition is inevitable , so do 59 % of opponents .
Women in our survey said men had an easier path to political leadership , and they also were more likely to say that having more female leaders would improve the quality of life for women . About three-quarters ( 73 % ) of women said it 's easier for men to get elected to high political office , while 58 % of men agreed . And 38 % of women said that having more women in top political or business leadership positions would improve the quality of life for all women `` a lot . '' Only half as many men ( 19 % ) agreed . There were similar differences by political party on this question , with more than twice as many Democrats ( 39 % ) as Republicans ( 17 % ) saying that having more women in high political office would improve the lives of women , while independents ( 28 % ) ranked in the middle . In 2015 , there were 104 women in Congress , a record number representing 19 % of all Senate and House seats . There was no overall consensus among the public in our survey on what holds women back from gaining top elective offices , though women were far more likely than men to cite societal and institutional factors as major reasons . About half ( 47 % ) of women said that a major reason there are not more women in top political offices is that female candidates are held to higher standards than men , compared with 28 % of men who said so . Four-in-ten women ( 41 % ) , compared with three-in-ten men ( 31 % ) , said that a major reason for the lack of women in top political offices is that many Americans are n't ready to elect a woman to a higher office . And 33 % of women , compared with 21 % of men , said that females getting less support from party leaders is a major reason . Relatively small shares of men ( 15 % ) and women ( 18 % ) said that family responsibilities are a major reason that fewer women hold elective offices . There were generational differences among women in our survey on the attributes that a woman brings to political office . Younger women were less likely to give female leaders an edge over male leaders , and instead were more likely to say men and women are equally likely to possess certain traits . For example , when it comes to working out compromises , 33 % of Millennial women and 37 % of Generation X women said women are better than men , compared with about half of women from the Baby Boomer ( 47 % ) and Silent ( 50 % ) generations who said so . Asked about which gender is better at working to improve Americans ' quality of life , only 22 % of Millennial women and 24 % of Gen X women said female leaders are better , compared with 39 % of Baby Boomer women and 35 % of Silent generation women who said so .
After a period of steady decline , Barack Obama 's overall job approval has edged up to 45 % from a low of 41 % in early November . Yet even with this uptick , Obama 's job approval is 10-points down from a year ago , following his re-election .
Many Germans see the U.S. as a top foreign policy partner ; fewer Americans feel the same way about Germany . When asked which countries are their most important partners in global affairs , Germans name France more than any other country , but the U.S. is in the second spot . More than four-in-ten Germans say the U.S. is either their country 's first or second most important partner . Americans are much less likely to see Germany this way : Only 12 % name Germany as one of America 's top two partners . Still , Germany does make the top four , trailing Great Britain and China and tying with Israel . Democrats are more likely than Republicans to see Germany as an important partner for foreign policy . While 21 % of Democrats name Germany as one of America 's top two international partners , only 5 % of Republicans feel this way . Democrats also take a more positive view of Germany 's role in world affairs – 52 % of Democrats say Germany does the right amount to help solve global problems , compared with 31 % of GOP supporters and 37 % of independents .
Globally , internet use is much more common in wealthier countries . The percentage of people who are online in each country is highly correlated with countries ' gross domestic product per capita ( PPP ) . Regionally , internet use is lowest in sub-Saharan Africa , where a median of 41 % across six countries use the internet . South Africa ( 59 % ) is the only country in the region where at least half the population is online . Still , the gap in internet use between emerging and advanced economies has narrowed . Whereas internet use in many of the world 's advanced economies has plateaued in recent years , use in sub-Saharan Africa has notably increased . In 2014 , 15 % of sub-Saharan Africans owned a smartphone , compared with 33 % who own one today . The number of people connected to the internet is likely to continue to rise , too ; industry projections suggest that the smartphone adoption rate in sub-Saharan Africa will double by 2025 .
The pattern was very similar in the 2010 primaries , based on voter records , but the estimated level of turnout is considerably lower than 2014 self-reports ( 25 % of those matched to the voter file were recorded as voting in a primary ) . Consistent conservatives again stand out , with 48 % recorded as having voted in a primary in 2010 , compared with 32 % among consistent liberals , 29 % among those with mostly conservative views , 22 % among those with consistent liberal views and just 14 % among those with mixed views .
Many of the responses we received in this survey , conducted this summer , mentioned one of the major presidential candidates as the `` political or social issue '' they changed their minds on . Around one-in-five users mentioned either Hillary Clinton ( 21 % ) or Donald Trump ( 18 % ) , and around one-in-ten referenced Bernie Sanders :
Political and religious differences are somewhat less stark , but still apparent , in views of how friendly the media and scientists are toward religion . Pluralities of independents and Democrats say the media and scientists are neutral to religion . But majorities of Republicans ( 51 % ) and white evangelical Protestants ( 52 % ) in the survey say the news media are unfriendly toward religion . And almost half of weekly worship attenders say the media are unfriendly toward religion ( 46 % ) , compared with 29 % among those who attend religious services less often . Republicans , evangelicals , black Protestants and weekly churchgoers also stand out compared with other groups for viewing scientists as unfriendly toward religion .
Currently , 43 % say their financial situation is excellent or good , 39 % say it is only fair , while 17 % rate their finances as poor . Most adults ( 61 % ) expect their financial situation to improve at least some over the next year .
President Bush received a striking 78 % of the votes of white evangelicals in 2004 , up 10 percentage points from 2000 and by far his highest level of support from any demographic group in the population . As he began his second term in office , the president had an approval rating of 72 % among evangelicals , compared with 50 % in the public as a whole . But evangelicals ' ratings of the president have declined as much since January 2005 as they have among the rest of the public . One year ago in the aftermath of the federal government 's response to Hurricane Katrina , just 54 % of evangelicals approved of Bush 's performance in office ; his overall approval rating was 36 % . Since then , the president 's ratings among evangelicals have fluctuated , rallying to 64 % in December 2005 and slumping to a low of 52 % in July of this year . Today , Bush 's rating among evangelicals is 57 % , compared with 37 % among the public overall .
Despite their mixed feelings toward American power , Germans clearly prefer the U.S. as the world 's leading power over China . Nearly six-in-ten Germans say having the U.S. as the top global power would be better for the world , with only 19 % saying this about China . However , 17 % in Germany volunteer `` neither '' when asked the question .
The public is divided over President Obama 's recent executive action that expands the number of undocumented immigrants permitted to stay and work in the U.S. At the same time , Americans continue to broadly support a pathway to legal status for people in this country illegally . The new national survey by the Pew Research Center and USA TODAY , conducted Dec. 3 - 7 among 1,507 adults , finds that 70 % say there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally , if they meet certain requirements . Most of those who support legal status think there should be a way for unauthorized immigrants to become citizens ( 43 % overall ) , while 24 % say the path should only include permanent residency . These opinions are little changed from October .
Public acceptance of homosexuality has increased in a number of ways in recent years , though it remains a deeply divisive issue . Half of Americans ( 51 % ) continue to oppose legalizing gay marriage , but this number has declined significantly from 63 % in February 2004 , when opposition spiked following the Massachusetts Supreme Court decision and remained high throughout the 2004 election season . Opposition to gay marriage has fallen across the board , with substantial declines even among Republicans .
In a Pew Research Center survey conducted Sept. 4-Oct. 1 , 2018 , Facebook users were directed to open and review their own ad preference page in order to complete the survey . That survey found that roughly nine-in-ten U.S. adults who use Facebook reported that they had information compiled about them on their Facebook ad preferences page . But a new analysis of this data finds that how Facebook categorizes these users , when it comes to the number of categories and their accuracy , varies by how often someone uses the platform . Frequent Facebook use – as well as having an account for a longer period of time – generally results in more ad categories . Nearly four-in-ten Facebook users ( 37 % ) who saw categories listed on their ad preferences page found 21 or more categories , whereas 30 % found one to nine categories . When accounting for how often they use the site , some 44 % of Facebook users who said they use the site several times a day reported finding 21 or more categories listed on the ad preferences page , compared with 34 % of those who use the site once a day and 20 % of those who said they use the site less often . There are also differences when it comes to how long a user has been on Facebook . The longer a person has had an account on the platform , the more categories Facebook lists for them . About half of users with Facebook accounts that were more than a decade old ( 52 % ) at the time of the survey reported finding 21 or more categories listed on their ad preferences page . In comparison , 36 % of accounts 5 to 10 years old and 27 % of accounts less than 5 years old had more than 20 categories listed . About a third of accounts less than a decade old had fewer than 10 categories listed on the ad preferences page , whereas only 18 % of accounts over a decade old had fewer than 10 categories listed .
The iPhone is , along with Google 's Android , one of the two dominant smartphone platforms in the United States . As of May 2013 , according to a recent Pew Research Center report on smartphone ownership , 25 % of all U.S. cellphone owners– and 43 % of smartphone owners — own an iPhone , a few percentage points behind Android . Other smartphone platforms — Microsoft 's Windows Phone , the fading BlackBerry , the handful of Palms still in use — are far behind .
Turks are divided on the direction of their country . Roughly half ( 51 % ) are dissatisfied with the way things are going in Turkey , while 44 % are satisfied . Over the past four years , opinion on this this question has generally been split . However , prior to 2011 , the mood in Turkey was much more negative , with clear majorities expressing dissatisfaction with the country 's direction every year from 2002 to 2010 . And in 2002 , following a severe economic crisis , 93 % of the Turkish public was dissatisfied and only 4 % satisfied .
Most Americans continue to say that they have `` old-fashioned values about family and marriage , '' but the percentage endorsing this sentiment has declined in recent years . Currently , 76 % say they have old-fashioned values , down from 85 % a decade ago and 87 % in 1987 . Moreover , the percentage completely agreeing with this statement has declined significantly — from a high of 53 % in 1999 to 41 % in the current survey . Views of whether there are clear and immutable guidelines about good and evil have been more stable over time . Currently , 79 % agree that `` there are clear guidelines about what 's good and evil that apply to everyone regardless of their situation . '' That opinion has not changed much in the past 20 years ; nonetheless , as is the case with views on old-fashioned values , the percentage completely agreeing with this statement has fallen , from 47 % in 1999 to 39 % currently .
For many people , both potential advancements also raised concerns about increasing social inequality . Two-thirds of those polled about radical life extension thought the option would only be available to the wealthy . At least as many in the human enhancement survey shared this concern , saying that moving forward with the three emerging technologies outlined in the survey – brain implants , synthetic blood and gene editing for babies – would increase inequality because they would only be available to those who are well-off . Two-thirds of American adults also said scientists would offer life extension technologies before their impact was fully understood . Again , this wariness is matched and even exceeded in the human enhancement survey ; more than seven-in-ten adults said brain , blood and gene enhancements would be employed before their effects were fully understood .
LGBT adults believe that greater social acceptance has come as a result of more Americans knowing someone who is lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender , according to our survey . Individual relationships and the role of well-known public figures , like Ellen DeGeneres , are viewed as being the most helpful things in fostering acceptance . Seven-in-ten LGBT adults say people knowing someone who is lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender helps a lot in making society more accepting , and 24 % say this helps a little .
In a Pew Research Center survey conducted last month ( Dec. 5 - 9 ) , 50 % of adults said they sympathized more with Israel in its dispute with the Palestinians . Just 10 % sympathized more with the Palestinians , while about as many ( 13 % ) volunteered that they sympathized with neither side .
By nearly three-to-one ( 73 % to 25 % ) , the public supports requiring better vehicle fuel efficiency . An identical percentage ( 73 % ) favors federal funding for alternative energy research , while two-thirds ( 67 % ) back more spending on mass transit .
The large drop in new arrivals is almost entirely due to a drop in the number of Mexican unauthorized immigrants coming to the U.S . In 2017 , Mexicans accounted for 20 % of unauthorized immigrants who came to the U.S. in the previous five years , compared with 52 % in 2007 . This represents a decrease in the average annual inflow of Mexican unauthorized immigrants , from about 375,000 per year in 2002 - 2007 to about 90,000 per year for 2012 - 2017 . For other regions of birth , the average annual inflows did not change significantly , but the shares of the total increased due to declining Mexican arrivals .
Over time , the data show that workers at political organizations are making more than they used to . On average , workers in this category made $ 51,000 in 2013 , 76 % more than the $ 29,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars they made in 1978 . The pay for workers at political organizations also has begun fluctuating over the past decade , with off-year pay being slightly higher than election-year pay . In 2011 , the average annual pay was $ 49,000 . In 2012 , that figure dropped to $ 44,000 , before rising again to $ 51,000 in 2013 .
Since 2018 , comparably small shares of registered voters in both parties have changed parties . About one-in-ten voters ( 9 % ) who affiliated with the Republican Party or leaned Republican in September 2018 now identify as Democrats or lean Democratic . An identical share of voters ( 9 % ) who two years ago identified as Democrats or leaned Democratic now align with the GOP .
Labor force participation differs substantially by sex and across the groups defined by immigration status . Among men ages 18–64 , natives are the least likely to be in the civilian non-institutional labor force ( 83 % ) followed by legal immigrants ( 86 % ) and then by the group most likely to be working—the unauthorized ( 92 % ) . There appear to be a number of factors associated with these differences . One of the simplest is age . Within this age range for workers , those who are older ( e.g. , 45–64 ) are more likely to be retired or disabled and so , not in the labor force . Very few unauthorized fall in this age range , so overall , they are simply more likely to be working .
But while cellphone surveys can produce high-quality data that in some ways are superior to results of current dual-frame ( landline plus cellphone ) designs , neither Pew Research Center nor the telephone survey industry more generally is poised to immediately drop landline samples . Landline interviewing is roughly 30 % -50 % less expensive on a per-interview basis than cellphone interviewing . As a result , landlines remain an attractive option for achieving a fixed total sample size ( e.g. , n=1,000 ) , even though the effective sample size after weighting is lower than would typically be achieved dialing only cellphones .3 There are also certain topics , such as experiences of elderly Americans and voter intention in low turnout elections,4 that landlines are still particularly useful for addressing . For key , commonly asked questions such as partisan affiliation , the difference between the published total sample estimates – based on landlines and cellphones – and estimates based just on the cellphone sample has tended to be quite small . For example , in April 2012 , the share of U.S. adults identifying as Republican or leaning Republican was nearly identical when computed using the total sample ( 39 % ) versus just the cellphone sample ( 40 % ) . The result was highly similar in a September 2015 survey ( 41 % for total sample versus 42 % for the cellphone sample ) . The contours of trends also appear to be largely unaffected by dropping landlines . Both the total sample estimates and the cellphone sample estimates show President Obama 's job approval numbers increasing from the mid-40s to the low 50s in 2012 , dipping in 2013 - 2014 , and then rebounding slightly in 2015 .
Teens say anxiety and depression are a major problem among their peers . Seven-in-ten U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 said in a 2018 survey that anxiety and depression were a major problem among people their age in the community where they live – a pattern that does not vary substantially by household income . When asked about their own lives , a majority of teens ( 61 % ) said they face a lot of pressure to get good grades in school . About three-in-ten said they feel tense or nervous about their day almost daily , and the same share wished they had more friends .
Americans continue to be split in their preferences for the size and scope of government : 48 % of adults say they would rather have a smaller government with fewer services provided , while 46 % say they would prefer a bigger government with more services .
With more attention being paid to economic inequality in the United States , it 's also worth looking at how the nation compares globally . As it happens , the U.S. has one of the most unequal income distributions in the developed world , according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — even after taxes and social-welfare policies are taken into account .
A similar pattern exists with regard to whether Americans perceive a lot of discrimination against Muslims . Those who are most familiar with Islam are significantly more likely than those with minimal exposure to say that there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims today . Seven-in-ten say this , compared with just 44 % of those with a low level of familiarity . As on the question of Islam and violence , a large portion ( 25 % ) of those with minimal knowledge of Islam say they do not know whether there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims today .
Currently , just 11 % rate current economic conditions as excellent or good . Nearly half ( 46 % ) say conditions are only fair while about the same percentage ( 43 % ) rate them as poor . The number saying the economy is poor has declined in recent months – from 56 % last August to 43 % currently . But positive views of economic conditions have not risen .
Republicans hold a 49 % -40 % lead over the Democrats in leaned party identification among whites . The Democrats hold an 80 % -11 % advantage among blacks , and lead by more than two-to-one among Hispanics ( 56 % -26 % ) . Asian Americans also lean Democratic by a wide margin ( 65 % -23 % ) . This data for Asian Americans is based on interviews conducted in English . Back to top
Young adults and part-time workers are especially likely to have been personally affected by workforce automation . In 2017 , 13 % of those ages 18 to 24 had either lost a job or had pay or hours reduced because their employers replaced their positions with a machine , robot or computer program . That compares with slightly smaller shares of those ages 30 and older . Those employed part time were also slightly more likely than those employed full time ( 11 % vs. 5 % ) to cite these personal impacts from automation .
Although interest in Iraq news has declined this year , it has been the top story in the weekly News Interest Index far more often than any other story . Last week , however , about as many people named the 2008 election as cited the Iraq war as the story they followed most closely ( 22 % vs. 20 % ) . A week earlier , the California wildfires were the dominant story in terms of news interest : roughly four times as many named the wildfires as the week 's top story as cited the war in Iraq ( 46 % vs. 12 % ) . News coverage of Iraq during 2007 also was higher in January than it has been for most of the period since then . In January , news organizations devoted 26 % of the overall newshole to three main elements of the Iraq story — the Iraq policy debate , events in Iraq , and news about the homefront — according to data collected by the Project for Excellence in Journalism for its News Coverage Index . The track of news coverage for the year shows that the Iraq policy debate has consistently received more coverage than have events in Iraq , according to the PEJ data . Indeed , during the two months in which news organizations have provided the greatest amount of overall news coverage of Iraq — January and September — the bulk of that coverage has been focused on the policy debate rather than on events in Iraq . In January , of the 26 % of news coverage on Iraq , 18 % was focused on the policy debate , while just 6 % of the coverage was of news about events in Iraq . That was the case in September as well , when news organizations devoted more than twice as much coverage to the Iraq policy debate than to events in Iraq ( 16 % vs. 6 % ) .
Additionally , over the last few years , Pakistanis have become less willing to work with the U.S. on efforts to combat extremist groups . While 50 % still want the U.S. to provide financial and humanitarian aid to areas where extremists operate , this is down from 72 % in 2009 . Similarly , fewer Pakistanis now want intelligence and logistical support from the U.S. than they did three years ago . And only 17 % back American drone strikes against leaders of extremist groups , even if they are conducted in conjunction with the Pakistani government .
Most American Catholics are comfortable with family arrangements that have been traditionally frowned upon by the church . For example , most U.S. Catholics say it is at least `` acceptable '' – and many say it is just `` as good as '' any other arrangement – for children to be raised by unmarried parents , gay or lesbian parents , single parents or divorced parents . Majorities also are accepting of a husband and wife who choose not to have children , a man and woman living together romantically without being married , and a same-sex couple living together . Among all U.S. adults who were raised Catholic , half ( 52 % ) have left the church at some point in their life . This includes some whose departure was only temporary : 11 % of all people raised Catholic left the church but later returned . But about four-in-ten of those raised Catholic now do not identify as Catholic by religion , including 28 % who do not identify as Catholic in any way ( `` ex-Catholics '' ) .
About eight-in-ten adults ( 78 % ) feel that public libraries help them find information that is trustworthy and reliable and 76 % say libraries help them learn new things . Also , 56 % believe libraries help them get information that aids with decisions they have to make . A large majority of Millennials ( 87 % ) say the library helps them find information that is trustworthy and reliable , compared with 74 % of Baby Boomers ( ages 52 to 70 ) who say the same . More than eight-in-ten Millennials ( 85 % ) credit libraries with helping them learn new things , compared with 72 % of Boomers . And just under two-thirds ( 63 % ) of Millennials say the library helps them get information that assists with decisions they have to make , compared with 55 % of Boomers .
A 49 % plurality of the public approves of the way Barack Obama is handling his job as president , while 40 % disapprove . Obama 's job approval rating has been relatively stable over recent months , though the percentage disapproving has edged up four points , from 36 % in November to 40 % in the current survey . Over the course of the year , Obama 's approval rating has declined substantially . In February , 64 % approved of his job performance while just 17 % disapproved . Obama 's job approval rating first fell below 60 % in July and in recent months has remained at around 50 % .
A 2013 Pew Research Center survey of Hispanic adults finds that some 45 % of Puerto Rican adults identify themselves as Catholic . About three-in-ten ( 29 % ) Puerto Ricans are Protestant , and among all Puerto Ricans , 8 % are mainline Protestants and 22 % are evangelical Protestants . Two-in-ten Puerto Ricans are religiously unaffiliated . By contrast , among all Hispanics , 55 % identify as Catholic , 22 % identify as Protestant , and about two-in-ten ( 18 % ) are unaffiliated .
The most closely followed story this week was the ongoing rollout of the 2010 Affordable Care Act , with 37 % saying they followed reports `` very closely . '' Roughly equal shares of Republicans ( 43 % ) and Democrats ( 36 % ) followed health care news closely . About one-in-three followed news about Typhoon Haiyan and the U.S. economy very closely ( 32 % each ) . In its second week in the headlines , bullying accusations within the Miami Dolphins football team were followed by 14 % of the public . Men ( 17 % ) are more likely than women ( 11 % ) to say they followed the story very closely . Americans express relatively limited interest in news about Toronto Mayor Rob Ford , as well as news about new guidelines for the use of statins or the FDA 's proposal to severely limit the use of artificial trans fats .
But it is also likely that the language and context of the question are substantial factors . Where the first three polls said the DOJ subpoenaed , obtained through a court order , or secretly collected the phone records , the Fox News question used the phrase secretly seized to describe the DOJ 's actions . The Fox News survey also pointed out that the records were extensive , included both work and personal phones , and that they did so without giving the news organization prior notice , as is customary . By two-to-one ( 60 % vs. 31 % ) more said this action by the government went too far rather than was probably justified . An additional factor that likely affected the responses to the Fox News question was the context in which it was presented . Immediately prior to asking about the legitimacy of the DOJ 's actions , Fox News asked : Does it feel like the federal government has gotten out of control and is threatening the basic civil liberties of Americans , or does n't it feel this way to you ? There is a long track record in the survey industry of how framing a question in a particular context can affect responses , and there is little doubt that raising this broad criticism of government – which roughly two-thirds ( 68 % ) of respondents agreed with – prior to the DOJ question had some effect .
When asked to choose between the U.S. and China as the preferred leading power for the world , Americans clearly prefer their own country . But only 13 % of Russians choose the U.S. Nearly three times as many Russians prefer China ( 35 % ) over the U.S. , and a similar share of Russians volunteer `` neither , '' which might indicate displeasure with Russia not being offered as a category for this question .
On a typical day , 21 % of adults search for product information online . This is an increase from 15 % in 2007 and 9 % in 2004 .
Over just the past week , the share of Americans who oppose U.S. airstrikes in Syria has surged 15 points , from 48 % to 63 % , as many who were undecided about the issue have turned against military action . By contrast , the share of Americans who support airstrikes remains virtually unchanged : Just 28 % favor U.S. military airstrikes against Syria in response to reports that its government used chemical weapons . The new survey by the Pew Research Center and USA TODAY , conducted Sept. 4 - 8 , 2013 among 1,506 adults nationwide , finds that this growing opposition to Syrian airstrikes is intense : 45 % say they oppose airstrikes very strongly . That is roughly three-times the percentage ( 16 % ) that strongly favors airstrikes .
George W. Bush continues to be viewed more unfavorably ( 54 % ) than favorably ( 42 % ) ; however this rating reflects a modest improvement in views and marks the first time in several years that Bush 's favorability has edged into the 40s .
Among the public overall , 38 % describe themselves as independents , while 31 % are Democrats and 26 % call themselves Republicans , according to Pew Research Center surveys conducted in 2018 . These shares have changed only modestly in recent years , but the proportion of independents is higher than it was from 2000 - 2008 , when no more than about a third of the public identified as independents . ( For more on partisan identification over time , see the 2018 report `` Wide Gender Gap , Growing Educational Divide in Voters ' Party Identification . '' ) An overwhelming majority of independents ( 81 % ) continue to `` lean '' toward either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party . Among the public overall , 17 % are Democratic-leaning independents , while 13 % lean toward the Republican Party . Just 7 % of Americans decline to lean toward a party , a share that has changed little in recent years . This is a long-standing dynamic that has been the subject of past analyses , both by Pew Research Center and others .
A median of 34 % across the 13 countries surveyed believe the U.S. is the world 's leading economic power , while almost half ( 48 % ) say the same of China . South Korea and Japan – the two nations geographically closest to China among those surveyed – are the only countries where the U.S. is the most common choice for the leading economic power . In Australia , Canada and the European countries surveyed , China is the top choice . Overall , very few say the countries of the European Union are the world 's leading economic power , though 18 % in Germany and 16 % in Denmark hold this view .
By contrast , smaller religious groups may not have been harassed in as many countries simply because they are not present in as many countries . For instance , because of their dense concentration in a small number of countries , 99 % of Jews and Hindus lived in nations where members of their groups were harassed . And despite being one of the most geographically dispersed religious groups , 97 % of Muslims lived in countries where harassment of Muslims occurred in 2015 . ( By comparison , 78 % of Christians lived in places where Christians were harassed . )
When Indira Gandhi became the first and , to date , only female Prime Minister of India in 1966 , just one modern-day country – Mongolia – had previously seen a woman in power . By 1991 , the number of countries that had some experience under female leadership had reached 20 . Today , 70 countries have had some sort of female leadership ( elected , appointed , interim or other ) , including six of the 10 most populous countries in the world .
But , also consider : It is one thing to get married , it is another thing to stay married . In spite of the recent uptick in newlyweds since 2011 , it is still the case that fewer adults were currently married in 2012 ( 50.5 % ) than in 2011 ( 50.8 % ) . The share of adults presently married peaked around 72 % in 1960 .
Perceptions of the personal impact of free trade vary widely across different groups in the population . Older Americans and those with lower levels of income and education are the least likely to say their financial situation has been helped by free trade agreements . By contrast , the wealthiest and best educated are much more positive about trade 's effects on themselves and their families . For example , just 22 % of those with household incomes under $ 20,000 annually believe trade agreements have helped them financially ; 47 % think trade has hurt them . At the other end of the income scale , 55 % of those earning $ 150,000 or more say free trade has been good for them financially ; just 12 % say it has been bad . Roughly four-in-ten people in the West ( 43 % ) say free trade has helped their finances . That compares with 37 % in the Northeast and 33 % in the South . In the Midwest , just 31 % say trade has helped their financial situation and 42 % say it has hurt ­ a number that rises to 51 % among those making less than $ 40,000 annually .
Overall , Iraq was the dominant news story this past week , both in terms of interest and coverage . Fully 36 % of Americans followed news about Iraq very closely , and 34 % said it was the story they followed most closely . One-fifth of the news coverage across five major media sectors was devoted to the Iraq policy debate and events on the ground . By comparison , 13 % of the public followed the Smith story very closely and 16 % said it was their top story . Coverage of Smith 's death and the aftermath made up 10 % of the overall newshole and more than one quarter ( 26 % ) of cable news coverage – making it the top story by far for that sector . Other major stories of the week included the 2008 presidential campaign , mounting tensions between the U.S. and Iran , the exposé on conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , and the rescue of the Mt . Hood climbers . Public interest in the campaign edged up slightly from the previous week as did coverage – 22 % followed campaign news very closely and 12 % said this was their top story of the week . Campaign news made up 12 % of the newshole with a good deal of the coverage devoted to feuding between the Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama camps . Nearly three-in-ten Americans ( 29 % ) followed news about Iran very closely , as the focus shifted back to the nation 's nuclear program , and 9 % said this was their top story of the week . Coverage of this story accounted for 5 % of the newshole . The public was somewhat less interested in the Walter Reed story – 19 % followed it very closely and 5 % said it was their top story . Three percent of the week 's news coverage was devoted to this story . One-in-ten Americans paid very close attention to the Mt . Hood story and 4 % said it was the story they followed most closely last week . Media coverage was substantial early in the week , but fell off once the climbers had been rescued . Over the entire week , 3 % of the newshole was devoted to this story .
Mid-market newspapers – those with average Sunday circulations between 100,000 and 249,999 – were more likely than either lower- or higher-circulation newspapers to have experienced layoffs in 2018 . Roughly a third of mid-market newspapers ( 36 % ) had layoffs , compared with 18 % of lower-circulation newspapers ( those with a circulation between 50,000 and 99,999 ) and 29 % of high-circulation newspapers ( at least 250,000 ) . The share of layoffs at mid-market newspapers increased somewhat between 2017 and 2018 , while it declined for both lower- and high-circulation papers .
About four-in-ten Americans ( 43 % ) have followed news about the attacks on U.S. embassies in the Middle East and the killing of an American ambassador very closely , making it by far the most closely followed foreign news story of the year . The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , conducted Sept. 13 - 16 among 1,001 adults , finds that public interest in the presidential campaign has increased sharply in the past week . Currently , 42 % say they are following news about the presidential candidates very closely , up from 31 % a week earlier , immediately after the party conventions . As many followed the recent spate of attacks on U.S. embassies in the Middle East and the killing of U.S . Ambassador Christopher Stevens very closely ( 43 % ) as tracked campaign news very closely ( 42 % ) . News interest in events in the Middle East is as high today as it was in the early days of the `` Arab spring '' last year , or when the U.S. and its allies launched air strikes on Libya in April 2011 . ( For more , see `` Interest in Foreign News Declines , '' June 6 , 2012 . )
A third of Americans say they have heard a lot about the possible withdrawal of U.S. troops , while 46 % say they have heard a little ; 19 % say they have heard nothing about this . Republicans and Democrats are about equally likely to have heard about plans for withdrawal .
The decline in the view that the U.S. is the greatest country in the world has occurred across most demographic and political groups , but it has been particularly acute among Republicans . In 2011 , 52 % of Republicans said the U.S. stood above all other countries in the world , while 43 % said it was one of the greatest countries in the world , along with some others . Today , Republicans are 15 points less likely to say the U.S. stands above ; 37 % say it does , while 55 % say the U.S. is one of the greatest countries , along with some others . Democrats and independents continue to be less likely than Republicans to view the U.S. as exceptional , and fewer say this today than did so in 2011 . Currently , about a quarter of Democrats and independents say the U.S. stands above all other countries in the world ( down from about a third in 2011 ) .
A 2012 Pew Research Center survey found that roughly half of Americans ( 51 % ) say that a gay or lesbian person 's sexual orientation can not be changed , while 36 % say it can be changed . In 2003 , opinion on this question was divided , with 42 % saying one 's sexual orientation can be changed and an equal share ( 42 % ) saying it can not .
Compared with a decade ago , more Americans say protecting the environment and dealing with global climate change should be top priorities for the president and Congress . Nearly two-thirds of U.S. adults ( 64 % ) say protecting the environment should be a top priority for the president and Congress , while about half ( 52 % ) say the same about dealing with global climate change , according to a January 2020 survey . These shares have grown considerably since 2011 .
The number of women in Congress is at an all-time high . About a century after Montana Republican Jeannette Rankin became the first woman elected to Congress , there are 127 women in the legislature , accounting for a record 24 % of voting lawmakers across both chambers . ( In addition , four of the six nonvoting House members , who represent the District of Columbia and U.S. territories , are women . ) There are more women in the Senate than ever ( 25 ) , and in six states – Arizona , California , Minnesota , Nevada , New Hampshire and Washington – both senators are women , up from three states in the previous Senate .
Huckabee stands apart from the field when it comes to social issues . He is named by 27 % of likely voters as best able to handle social issues like abortion and gay rights , far more than any other candidate . On the other hand , Huckabee is the choice of relatively few as best able to deal with foreign policy and security issues ( 11 % say he is best able to handle Iraq , 11 % Iran and 10 % terrorism ) . Despite trailing Romney and Huckabee in the horse race , Giuliani is named by a plurality of Iowa Republican voters as best able to deal with terrorism ( 26 % ) and Iran ( 22 % ) , and he is in a virtual tie with Romney on Iraq ( 19 % vs. 20 % ) . And Giuliani is mentioned by fully 38 % of Iowa voters as the candidate with the best chance of defeating a Democrat next November , though as noted earlier most voters say they prefer a candidate closest to them on the issues rather than the most electable candidate .
Majorities in all Western European countries surveyed in 2008 except Spain said they were very or fairly concerned that their country had become too dependent on Russia for its energy resources : Roughly six-in-ten or more among British ( 67 % ) , German ( 62 % ) and French ( 58 % ) publics expressed concern ; the Spanish public was evenly split on this issue ( 46 % concerned , 47 % not concerned ) . More than half in Poland ( 58 % ) and the Czech Republic ( 54 % ) offered critical opinions of Russia . And ratings of Russia were even worse among Western European publics . Majorities in France ( 65 % ) , Germany ( 62 % ) , and Sweden ( 59 % ) expressed an unfavorable view of Russia .
Overall , a larger share of assistant professors ( junior faculty without tenure ) were nonwhite in fall 2017 , compared with fully tenured professors ( 27 % vs. 19 % ) . But junior faculty have n't diversified much faster than their senior , fully tenured counterparts . Between fall 1997 and fall 2017 , the share of nonwhite assistant professors grew by 10 percentage points , compared with 8 points for professors .
The long-standing tension between religious beliefs and the idea of same-sex marriage has been a key factor at play behind recently proposed bills in several states , most visibly in Arizona , aimed at protecting business owners who have religious objections to same-sex marriage . At the same time , however , new Pew Research Center data from 2014 show that just within the past year , growing shares of some Christian groups favor allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry . The sharpest change has occurred among black Protestants , only 32 % of whom favored same-sex marriage in our aggregated 2013 polling . A survey we conducted last month found that figure has now risen to 43 % .
The issue of income inequality is back in the news at a time when the U.S. public believes there is a growing gulf between rich and poor that is likely to continue , according to recent Pew Research Center surveys . A substantial majority of Americans ( 65 % ) said in an July 2012 Pew Research survey that they believed the income gap between the rich and poor had widened over the last decade . Just 20 % said it had stayed the same and 7 % said it was smaller . Most of those ( 57 % ) who believed the gap had grown said it was a bad thing for society .
Of the three inventions we asked them about , Americans are most interested in riding in a driverless car : 48 % would like to do this if given the opportunity , while 50 % say this is something they would not want to do . College graduates are particularly interested in giving driverless cars a try : 59 % of them would do so , while 62 % of those with a high school diploma or less would not . There is also a geographical split on this issue : Half of urban ( 52 % ) and suburban ( 51 % ) residents are interested in driverless cars , but just 36 % of rural residents say this is something they 'd find appealing . Other potential inventions appeal to a much smaller proportion of the public . One quarter of Americans ( 26 % ) say they would get a brain implant to improve their memory or mental capacity if it were possible to do so , while 72 % would not . College graduates are the main demographic group that stands out on this issue : 37 % of them would be willing to get a performance-enhancing brain implant if given the chance . Similarly , just one in five Americans ( 20 % ) would be willing to eat meat that was grown in a lab . Men express a greater willingness to do so than women ( 27 % of men and 14 % of women say they would give lab grown meat a try ) , and college graduates are around three times as likely as those who have not attended college to say this is something they 'd attempt ( 30 % vs. 11 % ) .
Post-Millennials – today 's 6- to 21-year-olds , also known as Generation Z – are on track to be the most racially and ethnically diverse generation yet . A bare majority of post-Millennials are non-Hispanic white ( 52 % ) , while a quarter are Hispanic . And while most post-Millennials are still pursuing their K-12 education , the oldest members of this generation are enrolling in college at a significantly higher rate than Millennials were at a comparable age .
Asked if they agree that `` success in life is pretty much determined by forces outside our control , '' Americans again offer more individualistic views than those expressed by Western Europeans . Only 36 % of Americans believe they have little control over their fate , compared with 50 % in Spain , 57 % in France and 72 % in Germany ; Britain is the only Western European country surveyed where fewer than half ( 41 % ) share this view .
Differences in perceptions of economic news emerged after Barack Obama took office . But they never have been as great as they are today . Four times as many Republicans as Democrats say the news they have been hearing about the economy is mostly bad ( 60 % vs. 15 % ) .
Asked specifically about this possibility , Americans are more reluctant to embrace gene editing when it could affect future generations . Roughly half of adults ( 49 % ) said gene editing would be less acceptable to them if the effects `` changed the genetic makeup of the whole population , '' versus just 17 % who said it would be more acceptable . When asked about an alternate scenario in which the effects of gene editing are limited to a single person , more Americans said it would be more acceptable than less acceptable ( 34 % to 23 % ) .
This shift in Democratic support is especially pronounced among women . Currently , 85 % of Democratic women think abortion should be legal in all or most cases , up 18 points from March . This is the highest level of support for legal abortion among Democratic women in the past two decades . By comparison , 71 % of Democratic men say abortion should legal in at least most cases , little changed from March ( 75 % ) . There are no similar divisions by gender among Republicans . Currently , 36 % of Republican men and 32 % of Republican women think abortion should be legal in at least most cases . For the most part , there have been only slight gender differences in Republican opinion about abortion over the past decade .
Still , even among those who like right-wing parties , confidence in Trump is limited , and there is no Western European country in which a majority of right-wing party supporters offer a positive assessment of the American president 's leadership in world affairs . Trump gets more negative ratings globally than Merkel , Xi or Putin . German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the only world leader included in the survey who receives more positive than negative reviews . Across the 37 nations polled , a median of 42 % express confidence in her , while 31 % say they lack confidence . Ratings for Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin are mostly negative , and Trump receives even more unfavorable assessments than both of them .
News about the condition of the U.S. economy and the government spending cuts that began taking effect March 1 were the public 's two top stories last week . Overall , 35 % said they followed economic news very closely ; 31 % followed news about the spending cuts very closely . Republicans and Democrats were about equally likely to follow news about the automatic federal spending cuts . The public paid far less attention to Catholic cardinals meeting in Rome to select a new pope ( 14 % very closely ) and reports about the U.S. stock market ( 14 % very closely ) . And just 10 % paid very close attention to the death of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
A substantial majority of Americans ( 77 % ) are able to correctly identify Edward Snowden from a photograph of the former government contractor who leaked classified information about the NSA . Nearly as many ( 74 % ) know that the Federal Reserve is primarily responsible for monetary policy and not tax , trade or energy policy . Other questions are more challenging . The most difficult question on the quiz asks respondents to identify the trend in the stock market since 2008 from four charts . Just ( 21 % ) correctly select the chart showing a steep drop in the Dow from 2008 to 2009 , followed by a gradual and steady recovery . Another question presents the pictures and names of four Supreme Court justices and asks respondents to identify the justice who has most often been the court 's swing vote in recent years ; just 28 % select the picture of Justice Anthony Kennedy . Previous news quizzes also have shown that the public is not knowledgeable about the Supreme Court and its members
Although equal employment rights is seen as one of the top policy issues in the community , relatively few LGBT adults report experiencing workplace discrimination directly , compared with some other forms of discrimination and exclusion . About one-in-five ( 21 % ) say they have been treated unfairly by an employer because of their sexual orientation or gender identity , ( 5 % say this happened within the past year and 16 % report that this happened but not within the past year ) . The experiences of different groups in the LGBT community vary : 26 % of gay men , 23 % of lesbians and 15 % of bisexuals say that they have been treated unfairly by an employer .
About half of voters ( 53 % ) say his election makes them feel `` uneasy , '' while nearly as many ( 51 % ) say it makes them feel `` hopeful . '' Smaller shares say his election triumph makes them feel `` scared '' , `` sad '' ( 41 % each ) , `` proud '' ( 36 % ) or `` angry '' ( 31 % ) .
Overall , about six-in-ten Americans say they are bothered `` a lot '' by the feeling that some corporations ( 62 % ) and wealthy people ( 60 % ) do not pay their fair share in taxes . Fewer American express strong concerns about the complexity of the tax system ( 39 % say they are bothered a lot by this ) , the amount they pay in taxes ( 27 % ) and whether poor people pay their fair share in taxes ( 16 % ) .
The Democratic Party 's advantage in party identification has widened over the past two decades , but the share of Americans who describe their political views as liberal , conservative or moderate has remained stable during the same period . Only about one-in-five Americans currently call themselves liberal ( 21 % ) , while 38 % say they are conservative and 36 % describe themselves as moderate . This is virtually unchanged from recent years ; when George W. Bush was first elected president , 18 % of Americans said they were liberal , 36 % were conservative and 38 % considered themselves moderate .
Majorities or pluralities in 22 of the 34 countries surveyed say men generally have more opportunities for high-paying jobs than women , including about two-thirds or more in Sweden , France , Japan , South Korea , Israel , Spain , the UK , Australia and Canada . More than four-in-ten in Greece , Nigeria , Russia , Lebanon and Argentina also think men in their country have more opportunities when it comes to getting high-paying jobs , but similar shares think opportunities are generally the same for men and women .
As previous Pew Research Center surveys have found , voters have very negative feelings about the presidential campaign . Far more say they have been feeling frustrated ( 57 % ) , disgusted ( 55 % ) or scared ( 43 % ) than say they are interested ( 31 % ) , optimistic ( 15 % ) or excited ( just 10 % ) . Yet only 9 % of voters say they feel indifferent about the campaign . Trump and Clinton supporters express similar levels of frustration ( 55 % and 53 % , respectively ) and differ little in their feelings of disgust ( 53 % vs. 48 % ) or fear ( 46 % vs. 41 % ) . Negative feelings about the campaign rose over the summer . The share of voters saying they 've been feeling frustrated has risen 8 percentage points since earlier in the summer ( from 49 % to 57 % ) . Similarly , a larger share now say they are disgusted ( 45 % then , 55 % now ) , while slightly more now say they are scared than said this two months ago ( 37 % then , 43 % now ) . There has been little change in the share expressing positive feelings about the campaign over the course of the summer .
While mobile networks in sub-Saharan Africa have spread rapidly , landline penetration in the seven countries surveyed is close to zero . A median of only 2 % across these nations say they have a working landline telephone in their house , with a median of 97 % saying they do not have one . There is little variation across the countries on landline ownership . Landlines are simply rare on the continent . By contrast , 60 % of Americans have a landline telephone in their household . ( However , the share of wireless-only households in the U.S. has been growing rapidly over the past decade as landline ownership falls . )
Users frequently contribute to crowdfunding projects as a way to help individuals in need . Fully 68 % of crowdfunding donors have contributed to a project to help someone facing some sort of hardship or financial challenge , making it the most common type of project of the five evaluated in this survey . In addition to these types of projects : Contributions to help someone in need are more often directed toward a person who is already known by the donor , as opposed to a stranger or a public figure . Among those who have contributed to a crowdsourced project to help someone in need , 63 % say they have given to help a friend of a friend or an acquaintance , while 62 % have contributed to help a close friend or member of their family . By contrast , just 7 % of these donors have given to a campaign to assist a public figure , while 28 % have given to help someone who was not a public figure but whom they did not know personally .
About two-in-ten ( 22 % ) say they followed news about candidates for the 2012 presidential elections more closely than any other news last week . About as many ( 18 % ) say their top story was Barack Obama 's annual speech to a joint session of Congress on Jan. 24 . Another 15 % say they followed news about the nation 's economy most closely , according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey , conducted Jan. 26 - 29 among 1,006 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press . By comparison , news coverage was not so evenly distributed . The 2012 campaign dominated coverage , accounting for a third of the newshole ( 33 % ) , according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism ( PEJ ) . The State of the Union made up 9 % of coverage and the economy 6 % .
Most strikingly , China heads the list of countries that are , on balance , satisfied with the way things are going at home . More than seven-in-ten Chinese citizens ( 72 % ) express satisfaction with their national condition , while fewer than one-in-five ( 19 % ) are dissatisfied . These figures represent a sharp improvement from 2002 , when only 48 % said they were satisfied with their country while 33 % were not . On this score , China far outstrips India , where only 41 % say they are content with national conditions . And in China , the level of satisfaction is more than three times higher than in Russia , where only 23 % are pleased with their country 's direction .
Americans and Germans also take differing stances on the U.S. military presence in Germany . People in the U.S. see their country 's military bases in Germany as much more important to the security of their country than Germans do : 85 % of Americans believe these bases are important to the U.S. 's security interests , and nearly six-in-ten see them as very important . Germans , by contrast , are not sold on the idea that American military bases are important to German security . While about half of Germans see U.S. military bases as important for their country 's national security , 45 % disagree .
Following major , end-of-term rulings on the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage , unfavorable opinions of the Supreme Court have reached a 30-year high . And opinions about the court and its ideology have never been more politically divided . The latest national survey by Pew Research Center , conducted July 14 - 20 among 2,002 adults , finds that most of the increase in unfavorable views of the Supreme Court has come among Republicans .
Protests in the wake of the December 2011 parliamentary elections brought to the fore questions about the fairness of the March 4 , 2012 presidential vote . Following Putin 's first-round victory , the public offers a mixed assessment of the balloting : 47 % believe the election was free from manipulation , while roughly a third ( 35 % ) disagree and 18 % are uncertain .
Americans overwhelmingly say that parents should be able to take leave from work following the birth or adoption of a child . And they say the same about workers who need to care for a family member with a serious health condition or to deal with their own serious health condition . But while most Americans support paid leave in each of these situations , about one-in-seven ( 15 % ) say men should n't be able to take paternity leave at all , paid or unpaid , according to a new Pew Research Center study .
There is a substantial – and growing – partisan divide on abortion , with Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party much more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners to support legal abortion in all or most cases ( 82 % vs. 36 % ) . There also are large gaps based on religious affiliation . For example , three-quarters of white evangelical Protestants ( 77 % ) say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases , while an even larger share of religiously unaffiliated Americans ( 83 % ) take the opposing view , saying that abortion should be mostly or entirely legal .
In both nations , there are partisan differences over what binds the two countries together .1 Among Americans , Republicans clearly see defense ties as most important ( 47 % ) , with 28 % naming economic and trade ties and just 12 % naming shared values . Democrats are almost evenly divided across the three options .
A majority of Americans and veterans associate discipline and patriotism with veterans . Majorities among veterans ( 61 % ) and the general public ( 64 % ) say most Americans look up to people who have served in the military . And veterans see themselves as more disciplined ( 84 % ) and patriotic ( 71 % ) than those who have not served in the military . Most Americans agree with this : 67 % of all adults say being disciplined better describes veterans than non-veterans , and 59 % say the same about being patriotic .
About a third ( 35 % ) say they followed news about winter storms in the eastern United States very closely ; 16 % say this was the news they followed most closely . Not surprisingly , interest was highest in the north east and the south . More than one-in-ten ( 13 % ) say they followed news about floods in Australia very closely ; 3 % say this was the news they followed most closely . Two other breaking foreign stories barely registered with the public . Just 4 % say they followed news about the collapse of the Lebanese government very closely ; 1 % says this was the news they followed most closely . And 3 % say they followed news about the independence vote in southern Sudan very closely . Less than 1 % say this was the story they followed most closely .
As has been the case throughout the campaign , Democrats are following election news more closely than Republicans and independents . Particularly during the late primary season and start of the general election , interest in the campaign was higher among Democrats than Republicans . In recent , post-convention surveys , Republicans and Democrats have both registered increasingly higher levels of interest in the campaign . Last week , 64 % of Democrats and 57 % of Republicans reported following the campaign very closely .
Those who fall in the top earnings category are also the biggest consumers of online news sources , with 80 % of higher-income internet users ( 74 % of the general population ) seeking news on the internet . Yet , the online news consumption patterns of this more well off group stand in stark contrast to those living in the lowest income households .1 , 2 , 3
That would seem to be at odds with recent survey results . A Washington Post/ABC News poll released this week , for instance , found that only 22 % of the public said they were inclined to re-elect their representative in Congress . The all-time low ( since 1990 ) was 17 % in August 2011 , just after that year 's debt-ceiling showdown . In the latest poll , two-thirds ( 68 % ) of people said they were `` inclined to look around for someone else to vote for , '' also a high for the Post/ABC poll .
Nearly three-quarters ( 73 % ) of Hispanic smartphone owners have used their phone in the past year to research a health condition , which is similar to the share for blacks . But whites are less likely to say they 've used a phone to seek out health information .
For the first time on record , households headed by someone with at least a bachelor 's degree received nearly a majority ( 49.7 % ) of aggregate U.S. household income ; nearly one out of every two dollars went to the college educated . In 2012 one-in-three households was college educated , so , put another way , half of the aggregate U.S. income goes to one third of the households .
Americans broadly agree that elected officials should avoid using heated language because it could encourage violence . Nearly three-quarters of Americans ( 73 % ) say this , while just a quarter believe that elected officials `` should be able to use heated language to express themselves without worrying about whether some people may act on what they say . ''
Getting shot : Relatively few minors ( ages 17 and younger ) are shot in any given year , according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's database of fatal and nonfatal injury reports . However , black youths are far more likely than white or Hispanic youths to be injured by gunfire or fatally shot .
As fact-checking organizations are increasingly being tapped to fight against misinformation , Republicans appear to have serious concerns about the fairness of these groups . Democrats , on the other hand , mostly think they are fair to all sides . Overall , Americans are split in their views of fact-checkers : Half say fact-checking efforts by news outlets and other organizations tend to deal fairly with all sides , while about the same portion ( 48 % ) say they tend to favor one side , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Feb. 19 to March 4 , 2019 . But members of the two parties do not see eye-to-eye on this question . Seven-in-ten Republicans say fact-checkers tend to favor one side , compared with roughly three-in-ten Democrats ( 29 % ) – a 41 percentage point difference . Conversely , most Democrats ( 69 % ) say fact-checkers deal fairly with all sides , a view shared by just 28 % of Republicans . Independents are more split , with 47 % saying fact-checkers tend to favor one side and 51 % saying they deal fairly with all sides – though independents who lean toward the Democratic Party and those who lean toward the Republican Party diverge sharply ( 65 % vs. 37 % say fact-checkers deal fairly with all sides , respectively ) .
More broadly , the public places technology companies somewhere in the middle of the pack in terms of their overall power in the economy relative to other industries and commercial entities . Asked about the relative clout of eight different groups or entities , just over half the public ( 55 % ) says technology companies have too much power and influence , similar to the share ( 57 % ) that thinks the energy industry has an outsize influence on the economy today . Larger shares of the public feel that pharmaceutical companies , advertisers , or banks and other financial institutions have too much power and influence today , while smaller shares think this is true of labor unions , small businesses or the farming and agriculture industry .
Of the 12 stressful events that we studied , on average , women were aware of a larger number of events that had occurred among people they knew . On average , men were aware of 7 % fewer stressful events among their closest social ties .
The share of Latinos in the U.S. who speak English proficiently is growing . In 2018 , 71 % of Latinos ages 5 and older spoke English proficiently , up from 59 % in 2000 . U.S.-born Latinos are driving this growth , as their share on this measure has grown from 81 % to 90 % during this time . By comparison , 37 % of Latino immigrants spoke English proficiently in 2018 , a percentage that has increased only slightly since 1980 .
The foreign-born population residing in the U.S. reached a record 44.8 million , or 13.7 % of the U.S. population , in 2018 . This immigrant population has more than quadrupled since the 1960s , when the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act took effect . Though growth has begun to slow in recent years , the number of immigrants living in the United States is projected to almost double by 2065 .
Fully two-thirds ( 67 % ) of Latinos say they expect their financial situation to improve over the next year , compared with 58 % of the general population who say the same . Also , two-thirds ( 66 % ) of Latinos say they expect their children to eventually enjoy a standard of living that is better than theirs is now . By contrast , just 48 % of the general public says the same .
The other core Republican group – Main Street Republicans – are more negative about Wall Street 's impact on the economy ; just 36 % say it helps more than it hurts , while 45 % say the opposite . Main Street Republicans are socially and fiscally conservative , but are much more skeptical of business than are Staunch Conservatives .
There were 1,501 black prisoners for every 100,000 black adults at the end of 2018 , according to a new report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics ( BJS ) , the statistical agency of the U.S. Justice Department . That was down sharply from 2,261 black inmates per 100,000 black adults at the end of 2006 , according to an earlier BJS study . These statistics only count inmates sentenced to more than a year in state or federal prison . They exclude inmates held in local jails and those sentenced to shorter periods of imprisonment . Imprisonment rates have also declined for the two other major racial or ethnic groups tracked by BJS – Hispanic and white Americans – though not as much as among blacks . Between 2006 and 2018 , the imprisonment rate fell 26 % among Hispanics and 17 % among whites . While their rate of imprisonment has decreased the most in recent years , black Americans remain far more likely than their Hispanic and white counterparts to be in prison . The black imprisonment rate at the end of 2018 was nearly twice the rate among Hispanics ( 797 per 100,000 ) and more than five times the rate among whites ( 268 per 100,000 ) .
Americans have varying views about the safety of online dating . Roughly half of Americans overall ( 53 % ) say dating sites and apps are a very or somewhat safe way to meet people , while 46 % believe they are not too or not at all safe . Public perceptions about the safety of online dating vary substantially by personal experience . A majority of Americans who have ever used a dating site or app ( 71 % ) see online dating as a very or somewhat safe way to meet someone , compared with 47 % of those who have never used these platforms . Among the public as a whole , women are far more likely than men to say dating sites and apps are not a safe way to meet people ( 53 % vs. 39 % ) . Views on this question also vary substantially by age , educational attainment and race and ethnicity .
When it comes to news about the overall economy , most continue to say that they 're hearing a mix of good and bad news ( 63 % ) , while 21 % say they are hearing mostly bad news and 14 % are hearing mostly good news . The gap between positive and negative perceptions has narrowed considerably since a year ago , when 31 % were hearing bad news and 7 % were hearing good news .
Publics are somewhat divided over the impact of immigration on crime , with a median of 38 % believing that immigrants are more to blame for crime than other groups and 45 % saying immigrants are no more to blame . The share who say immigrants are more responsible for crime ranges from 22 % in France and the UK to 59 % in Greece .
According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in mid-June – in advance of the court 's ruling – 48 % of the public disapprove of the 2010 Affordable Care Act , while 43 % approve . That 's little different from April 2010 – shortly after the law was enacted – when 44 % said they disapproved and 40 % said they approved .
The sharp decline in the U.S. population of unauthorized immigrants that accompanied the 2007 - 2009 recession has bottomed out , and the number may be rising again . As of March 2012 , 11.7 million unauthorized immigrants were living in the United States , according to a new preliminary Pew Research Center estimate based on U.S. government data . The estimated number of unauthorized immigrants peaked at 12.2 million in 2007 and fell to 11.3 million in 2009 , breaking a rising trend that had held for decades . Although there are indications the number of unauthorized immigrants may be rising , the 2012 population estimate is the midpoint of a wide range of possible values and in a statistical sense is no different from the 2009 estimate .
Having served as an assistant U.S. attorney , U.S. attorney and state attorney general in Alabama , Sessions would join at least 44 others with prior prosecutorial experience at any level of government , from local district attorneys to federal prosecutors . ( We excluded jobs at the Justice Department 's Washington headquarters from our definition of `` prosecutorial experience . '' Robert F. Kennedy , for example , served as an attorney in the department 's Criminal Division before becoming attorney general in 1961 , but that experience is not counted as prosecutorial . ) Sessions would join at least 39 other attorneys general who had been elected to some position other than to a prosecutorial job . ( We also excluded judicial positions filled through elections . ) The last U.S. senator to become attorney general was John Ashcroft of Missouri in 2001 . Having served in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1973 to 1986 , Sessions would join at least 25 attorneys general with military experience .
In a 2015 study that used a broader definition of the term – one that took into account how adults described their own race as well as the racial background of their parents and grandparents – Pew Research Center estimated that 6.9 % of the U.S. adult population could be considered multiracial . The 2015 study also explored the attitudes and experiences of these adults , revealing the complexities of multiracial identity . Here are five key findings from that report : Racial identity can change over the course of one 's life . While 69 % of Americans who reported more than one race for themselves in the 2015 survey said they always thought of themselves as two or more races , about three-in-ten ( 29 % ) said there was a time when they thought of themselves as only one race . Similarly , among adults who selected only one race for themselves but had a multiracial family background , 29 % said they once thought of themselves as being two or more races .
The GOP 's image has improved . In the aftermath of the election , the Republican Party 's image is more positive than it has been in years . Currently , about equal shares view the GOP favorably ( 47 % ) and unfavorably ( 49 % ) . The share that views the Republican Party favorably is up 7 percentage points since October and is 14 points higher than it was in April of 2016 .
As Republicans and Democrats prepared for their party conventions in June , our national survey painted a bleak picture of voters ' impressions of the presidential campaign and the choices they faced in November . Overall satisfaction with the candidates was at its lowest point in two decades and roughly four-in-ten voters told us it was difficult to choose between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton because neither would make a good president – as high as at any point since 2000 . The presidential campaign was also widely viewed as excessively negative and not focused on important issues .
Around seven-in-ten Hispanic voters ( 68 % ) say gun laws should be stricter than they are today , while 24 % say current gun laws are about right . Only 7 % say gun laws should be less strict . The survey was conducted several months after a mass shooting in El Paso , Texas , involving a suspect who said he targeted Mexicans . Among Hispanic Democratic voters , 80 % say gun laws should be stricter . Hispanic Republican voters are more evenly divided , with 44 % saying gun laws should be stricter and 42 % saying gun laws are about right .
The combined challenges of paying for college , and finding a job after graduation , has made times tougher for today 's young adults . Paying for college is also viewed as a greater challenge today than it was in the past . Fully 71 % of all adults say it 's harder for today 's young people to pay for college than it was for their parents ' generation . ( See `` How Today 's Economy is Affecting Young Adults . '' )
A significant share ( 85 % ) of Germans prefers European regulation of data privacy , trusting more in their own government 's capacity in this realm than in U.S. regulation . And , in the United States , men , the young , those with a college degree and high-income persons disproportionately lack faith in American standards protecting their data 's confidentiality . Overall , roughly half ( 49 % ) of Americans trust U.S. privacy standards . But only about four-in-ten high-income Americans ( 39 % ) share that trust compared with nearly six-in-ten low-income people ( 58 % ) , a 19 percentage point difference in views . There is a similar 14 point divide on the issue between those who have graduated from college ( 39 % ) and those without a college degree ( 53 % ) .
Across 37 countries surveyed in the spring of 2017 , a median of 48 % say they closely follow news about the U.S. , compared with 50 % who do not . ( While interest in U.S. news is high in many countries , overall , people around the world follow national and local news more closely than international news . )
Yet of those asked how difficult it would be to act on advice to quarantine if told they had the coronavirus , Americans express more varied views . Roughly three-in-ten adults say that it would be very ( 10 % ) or somewhat ( 22 % ) difficult to quarantine . Men are more likely than women to say so ( 35 % vs. 29 % ) , and younger adults are more likely to say it would be very or somewhat difficult to quarantine than those 65 and older . Education and income again play a role when it comes to the difficulty people might have in quarantining . Some 35 % of those with a high school diploma or less report it would be very or somewhat difficult to quarantine , compared with 29 % of those with a bachelor 's degree . And Americans are less likely to express difficulty as their income rises : 38 % of adults from households with lower incomes , 30 % of those from households in the middle income category and 26 % of those with higher incomes say it would be very or somewhat difficult to quarantine .
Large majorities of Hispanics and the general public ( both 70 % ) say the new coronavirus poses a major threat to the U.S. economy . But on other questions , Latinos ' concerns are more pronounced than those of the wider public . About two-thirds ( 65 % ) of Hispanic adults say the coronavirus outbreak is a major threat to the health of the U.S. population as a whole , compared with about half ( 47 % ) of the general public . More Hispanics than Americans overall say the outbreak is a major threat to their personal financial situation ( 50 % vs. 34 % ) , day-to-day life in their local community ( 49 % vs. 36 % ) and their personal health ( 39 % vs. 27 % ) .
One-in-five Americans are expected to be 65 and older by mid-century , and this could be a problem for the country . There is worry that government and household finances may be pushed to the brink by rising pension and health care expenditures . Economic growth , we are warned , might suffer with fewer workers and more retirees . But what does the public think ?
Excluding leaners , however , conservative Republicans ' share of the overall electorate has been more or less steady since 2004 , according to Pew Research analysis of national exit poll data : About a fifth of voters identified as conservative Republicans in 2012 . ( Liberal Democrats made up 16 % of the electorate in 2012 , continuing a modest but steady increase since 2000 . )
As Canadians head to the polls for a historically close federal election , a new survey finds that people in Canada are generally satisfied with their country 's current relationship with the United States . More than half ( 54 % ) say that Canada should remain about as close to the U.S. as it has been in recent years , with another 27 % saying Canada should be even closer and only 16 % saying they should be less close .
Americans believe automation will likely disrupt a number of professions , but fewer foresee their own jobs being at risk . In a survey conducted in May , a majority of U.S. adults said it is at least somewhat likely that jobs such as fast food worker ( 77 % ) and insurance claims processor ( 65 % ) will be mostly performed by machines in their lifetime , while around half expected the same to be true of jobs such as software engineer and legal clerk . On the other hand , only three-in-ten workers said it 's at least somewhat likely that their own jobs will be mostly done by robots or computers during their lifetimes , including just 7 % who said this is very likely .
Six-in-ten adults say the public K-12 education system has a lot of responsibility in making sure the U.S. workforce has the right skills and education to be successful in today 's economy , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in association with the Markle Foundation in 2016 . The only entity or institution that more people say has a lot of responsibility is `` individuals themselves , '' cited by 72 % of adults . Americans express a bit more ambivalence toward the role of colleges and universities in workforce preparation , with around half of adults ( 52 % ) saying these higher-education institutions should have a lot of responsibility in making sure workers have the right skills and education to succeed . About half ( 49 % ) say employers should have a lot of responsibility in this role , but people are less likely to assign a lot of responsibility to state ( 40 % ) and federal governments ( 35 % ) .
On average , people in advanced and emerging economies are considerably happier with their life situation than those in developing economies . On a ladder where 10 represents the best possible life and 0 represents the worst possible life , a median of 53 % in rich nations say they currently stand somewhere between 7 and 10 . Half in emerging markets say the same compared with just about a third in developing economies ( 34 % ) . Israel , the U.S. , Germany and the UK stand out as the happiest among advanced economies , with roughly six-in-ten or more saying they are near the top of life 's ladder . The Greeks are the least satisfied , and the only advanced public where a significant percentage places themselves near the bottom of the ladder ( 21 % saying 0,1,2 or 3 ) . In 12 of the 24 emerging markets , at least half rate their life satisfaction highly . Latin American publics are the most content , with roughly two-thirds or more in Mexico , Venezuela , Brazil and Argentina saying they are doing well . About six-in-ten or more say the same in several Asian countries including Vietnam , China and Indonesia . Middle Eastern publics , such as people in Tunisia , Jordan and Egypt , tend to be the least satisfied among emerging nations . In addition , few Ukrainians are happy with their current life situation , perhaps reflecting the considerable turmoil in their country . In each of these four nations , about two-in-ten or more put themselves at the bottom of the ladder with a rating of three or below , including nearly a third ( 31 % ) in Egypt . People in developing economies are much less satisfied with their lives than those in either advanced or emerging nations . In just two of the nine developing countries surveyed do more than half rate their life situation highly . And in four nations , a quarter or more say they are dissatisfied with their life today , including 30 % in Tanzania who give a rating of three or below , 29 % in Uganda , and 25 % each in Ghana and Kenya .
Drone Warfare : Washington 's use of drones to target extremists in countries such as Pakistan , Yemen and Somalia is likely to continue to fuel anti-American sentiment because it is widely opposed around the world . Among the 39 nations surveyed by the Pew Research Center in 2013 , half or more of the public in 31 countries disapproved of such military action . But U.S. drone strikes could well continue in 2014 . Half of Americans say such actions have made the United States safer from terrorism .
Goggle Trends show no surge in searches for popular privately run health information websites such as WebMd . But frequent users of such sites are likely to access them directly . And a Hitwise analysis shows that while most of these health-information websites show no clear uptick in visits as concern about the swine flu peaked , WebMd , the most popular of the group , showed a sharp increase in the frequency of visits . Moreover , Tancer 's review of the top search terms sending traffic to WebMd for the week ending May 2 , 2009 , shows that queries relating to swine flu symptoms are the most common on the list .
Most Americans ( 61 % ) say `` people are too quick to undergo cosmetic procedures in order to change their appearance in ways that are not really important , '' while a minority 36 % says `` it 's understandable that more people undergo cosmetic procedures these days because it is a competitive world and people who look more attractive tend to have an advantage . ''
Through the Millennium Challenge Corporation , the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) and other programs , the U.S. provides assistance to many African nations , and the 2013 Pew Research poll found a widespread belief that U.S. economic aid is having a positive impact . More than half in all six nations surveyed said American aid was having a beneficial effect on their country . Outside of sub-Saharan Africa , U.S. assistance is not always viewed so positively : The same question was asked in Egypt and Pakistan , where only 24 % and 8 % , respectively , saw American aid in a favorable light .
Views of what constitutes national identity also divide publics along party lines in some European countries . In the UK , 73 % of those who have a favorable opinion of the right-wing UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) say adhering to British culture is very important to being British . Just 44 % of those who have an unfavorable view of UKIP agree . In France , sharing French customs and traditions is tied to national identity for those who have a favorable view of the right-wing , populist National Front ( FN ) ( 65 % say it is very important ) . Just 39 % of those who hold an unfavorable opinion of the FN strongly link culture to being truly French .
Only around two-in-ten ( 19 % ) have a favorable opinion of the U.S. , with nearly three-quarters ( 73 % ) expressing a negative view of their NATO ally . Opinions of the U.S. have been relatively steady over the past decade , although prior to the 2003 Iraq War , opinions of the U.S. were on balance less negative . Turkish views toward the EU are also negative , with a quarter saying they have a favorable view of the EU and 66 % having an unfavorable opinion . In 2004 , prior to accession negotiations , 58 % of Turks had a favorable view of the EU . However , by 2007 , EU favorability was down to 27 % and has not recovered since .
Among the eight issues included in the survey , people seemed most comfortable with the practice of using contraceptives . Only a median of 14 % across the 40 countries said that using contraceptives ( we did not specify exactly what kind of contraceptive ) was morally wrong , while 54 % said they personally believed it was acceptable . A further 21 % said it was not a moral issue . Only in Pakistan , Nigeria and Ghana did half or more say contraceptives were immoral .
The number of impoverished children also declined across racial and ethnic groups . In particular , the numbers of poor Black and White children reached new lows in 2019 ( each around 3 million ) . While there are about as many White children as Black children living in poverty , it 's worth noting that there are more than three times as many White children as Black children in the U.S . The greatest decline was in the number of Hispanic children living in poverty . In 2019 , 3.9 million Hispanic children were living in poverty , down from 6.1 million impoverished Hispanic children nearly a decade earlier . But there are still more Hispanic children in poverty than any other racial or ethnic group , which has been the case since at least 2007 . This is probably because Hispanics are the largest and the youngest racial or ethnic minority population in the U.S. and because the Hispanic child poverty rate is relatively high ( 21 % ) .
An estimated 1.0 million to 1.2 million unauthorized immigrants lived in Germany in 2017 , up from 500,000 to 600,000 in 2014 , according to new Pew Research Center estimates based on the latest available data . The 2017 estimate includes 444,000 asylum seekers who were waiting for a decision on their case at the end of that year .
Significant shares of Facebook users have taken steps in the past year to reframe their relationship with the social media platform . Just over half of Facebook users ages 18 and older ( 54 % ) say they have adjusted their privacy settings in the past 12 months , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . Around four-in-ten ( 42 % ) say they have taken a break from checking the platform for a period of several weeks or more , while around a quarter ( 26 % ) say they have deleted the Facebook app from their cellphone . All told , some 74 % of Facebook users say they have taken at least one of these three actions in the past year .
While there are big gaps in average education levels among different religious groups , these disparities have been narrowing in recent decades because those at the bottom made the biggest educational strides . A new Pew Research Center study , analyzing data from 151 countries , looks at education levels of Jews , Christians , Buddhists , Hindus , Muslims and religiously unaffiliated adults ages 25 and older . The demographic study also examines changes in educational attainment over three recent generations . When measured by years of formal schooling , Jews have the highest average educational attainment , while Muslims and Hindus have the lowest . Christians have the second highest average years of schooling , followed by religiously unaffiliated adults and then Buddhists .
The Indian public , happy with its prime minister , believes the national government is doing the right thing for the country . More than eight-in-ten ( 85 % ) voice trust in the national government , including 39 % who express a lot of trust . BJP supporters ( 90 % ) are more trusting of the government than Congress backers ( 76 % ) . The public is also quite satisfied ( 79 % ) with the way their democracy is currently working . This includes 33 % who are very satisfied . Again , this is a partisan issue . BJP supporters ( 84 % ) are significantly more satisfied with Indian democracy than are Congress backers ( 65 % ) .
Unauthorized immigrants made up 5.1 % of the nation 's labor force in 2012 , numbering 8.1 million who were working or looking for work , according to previously published Pew Research estimates ( Passel and Cohn , 2014 ) . But as this new analysis shows , they account for a far higher share of the total workforce in specific jobs , notably farming ( 26 % ) , cleaning and maintenance ( 17 % ) , and construction ( 14 % ) .
In comparison , a smaller share of U.S. adults ( 26 % ) say the federal government 's policies to control the spread of the coronavirus are influenced a great deal by public health experts ' evidence . About one-quarter of Americans ( 24 % ) think such evidence does not influenced the federal government 's response too much or at all . ( The survey asked a random half of respondents to gauge the role this evidence played either in federal policies and the other half to rate its role in their state government 's policies . )
One-in-ten Hispanics say that they have been asked by police or other authorities about their immigration status . According to the Pew Hispanic Center 's 2008 National Survey of Latinos , nearly one-in-ten ( 9 % ) Hispanics said they had been stopped by the police or other authorities and asked about their immigration status in the year prior to the survey , with the native born and foreign born equally likely to have said this .
At the same time , the public generally believes it is acceptable for the government to monitor many others , including foreign citizens , foreign leaders , and American leaders . Yet , 57 % say it is unacceptable for the government to monitor the communications of U.S. citizens . At the same time , majorities support monitoring of those particular individuals who use words like `` explosives '' and `` automatic weapons '' in their search engine queries ( 65 % say that ) and those who visit anti-American websites ( 67 % say that ) .
More than two years after the death of Osama bin Laden , concern about Islamic extremism remains widespread among Muslims from South Asia to the Middle East to sub-Saharan Africa . Across 11 Muslim publics surveyed by the Pew Research Center , a median of 67 % say they are somewhat or very concerned about Islamic extremism . In five countries – Pakistan , Jordan , Tunisia , Turkey and Indonesia – Muslim worries about extremism have increased in the past year .
More than three quarters of the public say they heard at least a little last week about the recall of hundreds of millions of eggs after an outbreak of salmonella . Four-in-ten heard a lot about this , while 37 % heard a little . Just more than two-in-ten ( 22 % ) say they heard nothing at all . About three-in-ten ( 31 % ) say they heard a lot about the verdict in the corruption trial of former Illinois Gov . Rod Blagojevich . Another 42 % say they heard a little about a federal jury convicting Blagojevich on one count of lying to the FBI but deadlocking on the other charges . About a quarter ( 27 % ) say they heard nothing at all about this story . Fewer than two-in-ten ( 17 % ) say they heard a lot about Dr. Laura Schlessinger announcing she will end her radio show after controversy over her use of a derogatory racial term . Close to four-in-ten ( 38 % ) say they heard a little about this , but 44 % say they heard nothing at all .
An estimated 2 million Hispanics of Cuban origin resided in the United States in 2013 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Census Bureau 's American Community Survey . Since 1980 , the Cuban-origin population in the U.S. has more than doubled , growing from 822,000 to 2 million over the period . At the same time , the foreign-born population of Cuban origin living in the U.S. grew by 78 % , up from 636,000 in 1980 to 1.1 million in 2013 . In comparison , Mexicans , the nation 's largest Hispanic origin group , constituted 34.6 million , or 64.1 % , of the Hispanic population in 2013 .
Outside of the campaign , the economy and Iraq , Americans showed little interest in last week 's other news stories . Just 5 % followed news about the upcoming summer Olympics in Beijing very closely and even fewer ( 2 % ) called it their most closely followed story of the week . Interest was somewhat higher in news about a government proposal to overhaul national financial regulations ; 17 % of the public followed the story very closely , while 3 % called it their top story .
Student debt is less common among older age groups . Roughly one-in-five adults ages 30 to 44 ( 22 % ) have student loan debt , as do 4 % of those 45 and older .
Most U.S. adults think human activity , such as the burning of fossil fuels , contributes a great deal ( 49 % ) or some ( 32 % ) to climate change . About two-in-ten ( 19 % ) say human activity contributes not too much or not at all to climate change . Views on this question are about the same as they were last fall .
The public views tougher regulations on financial institutions as an important priority for Congress , but far more want Congress to take action on the job situation and energy policy . In thinking about financial regulation , as many say they worry that the government will go too far in regulating financial markets , making it harder for the economy to grow , as say they worry that the government will not go far enough , leaving the country at risk of another financial crisis .
Overall , 42 % agree with the Democratic Party 's policies on abortion either strongly ( 28 % ) or somewhat ( 15 % ) . A smaller share ( 32 % ) says they strongly ( 21 % ) or somewhat ( 11 % ) agree with the policies of the GOP . About a quarter ( 24 % ) says they do n't agree with either party on this issue .
Spaniards are not happy with the state of democracy in their country . Only about a third ( 32 % ) of Spaniards say they are satisfied with how Spain 's democracy is working . However , satisfaction with democracy has increased by 12 % since just last year , when the nation was in the midst of a corruption scandal that implicated and led to the ouster of the People 's Party ( PP ) , which was the governing party at the time .
A sizable share of the public expresses reservations about personally using each of the technological concepts examined in the survey . Nearly six-in-ten Americans say they would not want to ride in a driverless vehicle or use a robot caregiver for themselves or a family member , while roughly three-quarters would not want to apply for a job that used a computer program to evaluate and select applicants .
The public increasingly views the federal budget deficit as a major problem the country must address now . But fewer predict the country will achieve significant progress in reducing the deficit in five years than did so in December . A new survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press and The Washington Post , conducted April 21 - 25 among 1,001 adults , finds that 31 % say we will have achieved significant progress on the deficit in the next five years or so , down from 37 % in December . Fully 81 % see the deficit as a major problem that must be addressed now – rather than one that can be addressed when the economy improves – up from 70 % late last year .
Americans are largely skeptical of scientific understanding about both the causes of climate change and the effects of GM foods . Some 28 % of Americans think climate scientists understand the causes of global climate change `` very well '' ; 19 % think scientists understand the health effects of GM foods `` very well . ''
In other news last week , 28 % of the public followed the situation in Iraq very closely , unchanged from the previous week . Only 12 % listed the Iraq war as their most closely followed story of the week as most attention was focused on the California wildfires . One-in-five Americans followed the World Series very closely and 10 % listed this as their most closely followed story . The national media devoted 2 % of its overall coverage to the World Series .
The national public feels the bleak state of the economy . About eight-in-ten Brazilians ( 82 % ) say their country 's economy is bad . That figure is double the share of the public who said this in 2013 , one of the highest levels of economic dissatisfaction recorded in the global Pew Research Center survey .
While Americans believe China has assumed the leading position in the global economy , they see the military balance of power quite differently . Two-thirds ( 67 % ) think the U.S. is the world 's leading military power . Just 16 % say China has the top military , while 5 % name Russia , and 3 % the EU .
Events in Iraq were by far the most closely followed news story of the week . One-in-four Americans ( 24 % ) said this was the story they followed more closely than any other , greater than twice the number citing any other story listed . The Iraq policy debate in Washington also captured substantial public attention while finishing first ( 17 % ) in terms of news coverage . For 9 % of Americans , this was the story they followed most closely . The significant amount of coverage devoted to the president 's unannounced visit to Iraq and discussions leading up to the Iraq progress report from Gen. David Petraeus contributed to the story 's prominence in the news .
When those who say they have shifted to supporting same-sex marriage are asked why their views changed , people offer a range of answers . Roughly a third ( 32 % ) say it is because they know someone – a friend , family member or other acquaintance – who is homosexual . A quarter ( 25 % ) say that their personal views have changed as they have thought about the issue or simply because they have grown older . About one-in-five ( 18 % ) say they changed their minds to support gay marriage because the world has changed and that this kind of shift is inevitable . The same percentage ( 18 % ) say they changed their minds because they think people should be free to choose what makes them happy and that they no longer think the government should be involved in people 's personal lives in this way .
When asked about their confidence that different entities will use facial recognition tools responsibly , the public expresses much greater trust in law enforcement agencies than in advertisers or technology companies . A 56 % majority of U.S. adults trust law enforcement agencies at least somewhat to use facial recognition technologies responsibly , with 17 % indicating that they trust these agencies a great deal to use facial recognition . Several groups express relatively low levels of trust in law enforcement agencies to use facial recognition responsibly – most notably black adults , younger people and those who identify as Democrats . Roughly six-in-ten whites trust law enforcement agencies to use facial recognition tools , but that share falls to 43 % among blacks ( an 18 percentage point difference ) . Comparable gaps in trust exist between 18- to 29-year-olds and those ages 65 and older , as well as between Democrats ( including political independents who lean toward the Democratic Party ) and Republicans and Republican leaners . Prior surveys by the Center of broader public attitudes toward law enforcement have found that roughly eight-in-ten Americans have confidence that police officers will act in the best interests of the public , and that warm views toward the police are especially prevalent among whites , older adults and Republicans .
Respondents who have no religious affiliation are the most likely to think that science and religion , in general , are often in conflict , with 76 % expressing this view . But just one-in-six religiously unaffiliated adults ( 16 % ) say their own religious beliefs conflict with science . ( Those who are religiously unaffiliated often have supernatural beliefs and spiritual practices , even though they say they do not feel connected to a particular religion . Only about a third of the unaffiliated say they are atheist or agnostic ; most describe their religion as `` nothing in particular . '' )
Overall , 54 % of Americans say they pay about the right amount in taxes , considering what they get from the federal government , while 40 % say they pay more than their fair share . Just 5 % believe they pay less than their fair share . Currently those in higher income families are more likely than those in lower income families to feel they are paying more than their fair share . About half ( 52 % ) of those with annual family incomes of $ 100,000 or more say they pay more than their fair share . By comparison , just 30 % of those with family incomes of less than $ 30,000 say they pay more than their fair share .
Several recent surveys have tracked growing dissatisfaction within the Republican Party . Our July survey found that positive views of the GOP among Republicans had declined 18 percentage points since January , from 86 % to 68 % . By contrast , 86 % of Democrats viewed their party favorably . Republicans had much to celebrate after capturing both the House and Senate in the 2014 midterm elections , but their opinion of GOP congressional leaders soured during the first months of the new term . In May , Republicans ' approval of the performance of their leaders on the Hill fell to 41 % , and just 37 % said the leaders were keeping their campaign promises . By contrast , in April 1995 , after the GOP had recaptured both chambers of Congress for the first time in four decades , fully 80 % of Republicans said that their leaders were keeping their promises . Three-quarters of Republicans surveyed in May said their representatives in Congress should challenge President Obama more .
Majorities in Germany ( 71 % ) , Britain ( 62 % ) and Spain ( 59 % ) would also support a similar ban in their own countries . In contrast , most Americans would oppose such a measure ; 65 % say they would disapprove of a ban on Muslim women wearing full veils in public places compared with 28 % who say they would approve .
With the expectation that a far larger share of voters will cast their ballots by mail than in past elections comes the prospect that counting those ballots may take substantially longer than in past years . But about half of registered voters ( 52 % ) say it is very important that Americans know who won the election with a day or two of Election Day , and 82 % say this is at least somewhat important . By contrast , there is far less uniformity when it comes to the importance of people who are ineligible to vote being prevented from voting . While clear majorities of both coalitions say this is at least somewhat important ( 93 % of Trump supporters , 78 % of Biden voters ) , Trump supporters are much more likely to consider this very important : 86 % say this , compared with about half ( 49 % ) of Biden backers . Trump supporters also are substantially more likely than Biden supporters to say that knowing the winner of the election within a few days is important . More than nine-in-ten Trump supporters ( 94 % ) say it is at least somewhat important that the winner of the election be known within a day or two of the polls closing , including 69 % who say this is very important . While most Biden supporters ( 73 % ) say this at least somewhat important , only 39 % say it is very important .
The public 's views of Congress continue to hover near all-time lows . Just 22 % have a favorable opinion of Congress — equal to its rating last December — while 72 % feel unfavorably about Congress . With the GOP now in control of both houses of Congress , Republicans ' views of the institution are only slightly more positive than Democrats ' _ : 29 % of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Congress , compared with 22 % of Democrats ( and 19 % of independents ) .
Discomfort with the idea of a child marrying outside one 's own religious circle is widespread among Israelis . Nearly all Jews ( 97 % ) say they would not be comfortable with their child marrying a Muslim , and 89 % say this about a child marrying a Christian . Among Muslims , 82 % say they would be uncomfortable with a child marrying a Jew , and 75 % say the same about a child marrying a Christian . Christians and Druze also are strongly opposed to religious intermarriage .
In addition , the public has little confidence that the economy is on its way up . About a quarter ( 26 % ) say they expect economic conditions to be better in a year , nearly as many ( 22 % ) think they will be worse ; 51 % expect the economy to be about the same a year from now . There has been no increase in economic optimism this year .
Partisanship colors Catholics ' perceptions of how religious Trump and Biden are . Overall , around six-in-ten Catholics ( 59 % ) say they think Biden is `` very '' or `` somewhat '' religious , according to a February 2020 survey . White and Hispanic Catholics express similar views of Biden 's religiousness , but Democratic Catholics ( 72 % ) are far more likely than Republican Catholics ( 46 % ) to say that he is at least somewhat religious .
As is generally the case for views about China on specific issues , there is a notable partisan gap on the overall favorability measure . More than six-in-ten Republicans ( 63 % ) give China an unfavorable rating , compared with 51 % of independents and 50 % of Democrats . Negative assessments of China are also more common among older Americans . Fully 64 % of those ages 50 and older have a negative opinion , while just 39 % hold this view among people under age 30 .
The new study finds that numbers like these can leave people with the impression that the race is far less competitive than when they see polling data presented as the percentage of the vote they are expected to get – something familiar to the public .
For decades , the public has sympathized with Israel over the Palestinians and that remains the case today . Overall , five times more Americans sympathize with Israel than the Palestinians . In a survey conducted after last month 's conflict between Israel and Hamas forces in Gaza , 50 % said they sympathize more with Israel , compared with just 10 % who said they sympathize more with the Palestinians . Almost a quarter ( 23 % ) did not offer an opinion while 13 % volunteered that they sympathize with neither side , and 4 % said both . In May , 48 % sided with Israel compared to 11 % who backed the Palestinians . There continue to be stark partisan differences in Middle East sympathies . Conservative Republicans maintain strong support for Israel , with fully 75 % saying they sympathize with Israel compared with just 2 % who sympathize with the Palestinians . By contrast , liberal Democrats are much more divided : 33 % sympathize more with Israel , 22 % with the Palestinians . Independents sympathize more with Israel by a 47 % to 13 % margin .
Overall , the public continues to worry about Islamic extremism around the world and in the U.S. About six-in-ten ( 62 % ) say they are very concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world , and just about half ( 49 % ) say the same about the possible rise of Islamic extremism in the U.S . Comparable percentages said they were very concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism in September of last year . These are among the highest levels of concerns measured in the questions ' trend dating to 2007 . Republicans remain more likely than Democrats to say they are very concerned with Islamic extremism around the world ( 83 % vs. 53 % ) and at home ( 65 % vs. 38 % ) .
While overall approval of President Bush 's job performance has tumbled over the past year , he may still prove to be effective on the campaign stump for Republican candidates in certain parts of the country . In Pew Research Center surveys conducted over the past year , an average of 37 % of Americans register approval of the job George W. Bush is doing as president , while 55 % disapprove . But the president has significant pockets of support in certain areas , particularly in the South and Mountain West . Voters in Utah , in particular , remain strongly behind the president – over the past year , 63 % approve of his job performance . Similarly , in New Mexico , Oklahoma , Louisiana , Alabama and Kansas more voters surveyed in the past year approve rather than disapprove . Not surprisingly , the president 's job ratings are weak in many Democratic- leaning states . Just 24 % of Maryland voters interviewed over the past year give Bush favorable marks , while 67 % disapprove of his job performance , and the balance of opinion is nearly as bad in Massachusetts and Connecticut . Similarly , more voters in Oregon , Illinois , California and New York disapprove of the president than approve by margins of roughly two-to-one .
People who say they personally know someone who is transgender are more likely than those who do not to say society has not gone far enough in accepting transgender people . About half ( 52 % ) of those who know someone who is transgender say this , compared with 31 % of those who do n't know a transgender person . This is consistent with previous research that has suggested that people who have gay or lesbian acquaintances are more likely than those who do n't to support same-sex marriage . As far as what share of Americans say they know a transgender person , 37 % say they personally do , including 13 % who say they have a close friend or a family member who is transgender ( 9 % say they have a close friend and 6 % have a family member who is transgender ; respondents were allowed to select more than one answer ) . About a quarter of Americans ( 24 % ) say they have an acquaintance who is transgender , while 7 % say they have a transgender co-worker .
Another important trend has to do with marriages between spouses with similar education levels . Even though college graduates are increasingly more likely to marry each other , the overall share of couples of similar education levels is down from nearly 80 % in 1960 to about 60 % in 2012 . The primary reason for the decline in the share of married couples with similar education levels is that marriages between spouses with high school or less than high school education are much less common these days — the share is down from 74 % of all marriages in 1960 to 24 % in 2012 . In addition , adults with high school or less education are much less likely to marry . The marriage rate among this group plummeted —from 72 % in 1960 to 46 % in 2012 . Just the opposite has occurred among college graduates . The share of couples in which both spouses have a college degree has risen steadily in recent decades . In 1960 , only 3 % of couples were in this group , the share rose to 22 % in 2012 . Marriages between spouses with some college education were on the rise until 2000 ( from 3 % to 12 % ) , but have leveled off since then .
Not only do veteran households fare better overall economically , households headed by racial or ethnic minority veterans and those with lower levels of education have significantly higher standards of living than their non-veteran counterparts . In 2017 , the median incomes of non-Hispanic black and Hispanic veteran households were more than $ 20,000 greater than those of black and Hispanic non-veteran households . Among non-Hispanic whites , by comparison , the gap in median income between households headed by veterans and non-veterans was only about $ 5,100 . Income differences between veteran and non-veteran households are also large when examined by education level . The median income is roughly $ 20,000 higher for households headed by a veteran with a high school diploma , compared with non-veteran households with the same level of education . As education increases , the income gap between the two groups decreases to only about $ 2,500 .
Foreign-born Hispanics are more positive and knowledgeable about the 2010 U.S. Census than are native-born Hispanics , according to a nationwide survey of 1,003 Latino adults conducted March 16 - 25 , 2010 , by the Pew Hispanic Center , a project of the Pew Research Center . Overall , seven-in-ten ( 70 % ) Hispanics say the census is good for the Hispanic community . However , foreign-born Hispanics are more likely than native-born Hispanics to feel this way—80 % versus 57 % .
In addition , Democrats are more likely to name Germany as a top foreign policy partner for the U.S . Among Democrats , 21 % believe Germany is one of the two most important partners for the U.S. , putting it in the third spot overall behind Great Britain ( 32 % ) and China ( 26 % ) . Among Republicans , Germany is tied for the seventh spot , alongside Russia , with just 5 % of Republicans citing it as a top partner .
Last week 's report on unemployment underscored the catastrophic impact the coronavirus outbreak has had on the U.S. economy . The focus in many states has now turned to reopening businesses and getting people back to work . However , most Americans – including 68 % of those who have lost their jobs or taken a cut in pay due to the coronavirus outbreak – are concerned that state governments will lift restrictions too quickly , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . A similar share of Americans whose jobs were not affected say the same ( 69 % ) . On the other hand , only about three-in-ten U.S. adults in these categories expressed more concern that restrictions would not be lifted quickly enough .
Americans may not be raging optimists when it comes to finding work — perhaps `` skeptical realists '' is closer to the mark — but their self-assessment of the job market tracks pretty closely with official unemployment statistics . The nation 's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 5.9 % in September , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics figures out today . That represents a drop of 4.1 percentage points from the high of 10 % recorded in October 2009 — although , as we 've discussed before , some of that decline comes not from more people finding work but from more people dropping out of the labor force .
American Catholics are aging . The median age of Catholic adults in the U.S. is 49 years old – four years older than it was in 2007 . Catholics are significantly older than members of non-Christian faiths ( 40 ) and people who are not affiliated with any religion ( 36 ) . Just 17 % of Catholic adults are under the age of 30 , compared with 22 % of U.S. adults , 35 % of religious `` nones '' and 44 % of U.S. Muslims .
Among the uninsured , 47 % express an unfavorable view of the law compared with 24 % who regard it positively . That represents a negative shift since December when views were more divided , with 43 % seeing the law unfavorably and 36 % seeing it favorably .
As in the past , Democrats and Republicans have somewhat similar views of the Republican Party 's ideology : 64 % of Democrats and 51 % of Republicans say the GOP is either very conservative or conservative . But Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to view the Democratic Party as very liberal or liberal ( 75 % vs. 36 % ) .
Current Republican national leadership includes Rep. Paul Ryan ( age 43 ) with a 65 % favorable rating among Republicans and Independents who lean Republican according to a recent Pew Research Center survey . Not far behind Ryan is Sen. Rand Paul ( age 50 ) who has a 55 % favorable rating . He is closely followed by 42-year-old Sen. Marco Rubio with a 50 % favorable rating . Gov . Chris Christie at age 50 gets a 47 % favorable rating from the GOP faithful . In contrast , the Republican party 's older establishment leadership : House Speaker John Boehner ( age 63 ) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( 71 ) get markedly lower ratings . The youngest Republican , Sen. Ted Cruz ( age 40 ) , is still not well known by most Republicans nationally .
Opinions about Muslims in almost all of these countries are considerably more negative than are views of Jews . Fully half of Spanish ( 52 % ) and German respondents ( 50 % ) rate Muslims unfavorably . Opinions about Muslims are somewhat less negative in Poland ( 46 % ) and considerably less negative in France ( 38 % ) . About one-in-four in Britain and the United States ( 23 % each ) also voice unfavorable views of Muslims . Overall , there is a clear relationship between anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim attitudes : publics that view Jews unfavorably also tend to see Muslims in a negative light .
While blacks are more likely than whites to be Protestant or Muslim , they are significantly less likely to be Catholic . Only 5 % of blacks say they are Catholic , compared with 21 % of the public overall , including 19 % of whites , 48 % of Hispanics and 17 % of Asian Americans .
Despite their political differences , most Republicans and Democrats stop short of saying that people in the other party do not share their other values and goals beyond politics . Among both parties , about four-in-ten ( 41 % of Republicans and 38 % of Democrats ) say that members of the opposing party `` feel differently about politics , and they probably do n't share many of my other values and goals either . '' ( Note : these questions are based on partisans and do not include those who lean toward the parties ) .
Nearly seven-in-ten registered voters say postponing state primary elections has been a necessary step to address the coronavirus outbreak , according to a Pew Research Center survey . This includes about two-thirds of Republican voters ( 64 % ) and 71 % of Democratic voters .
The survey finds that a majority of Americans ( 60 % ) say the primary reason that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases is increasing is because there are more new infections , not just more testing for the disease . About four-in-ten ( 39 % ) say cases are rising primarily because more people are being tested than in previous months .
The public 's views of the Affordable Care Act , which were evenly divided following the Supreme Court 's ruling last summer upholding a key section of the law , are again more negative than positive . Currently , 44 % approve of the 2010 health care law , compared with 54 % who disapprove of the law .
Driven by unauthorized immigration from Mexico , U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions rose through the 1990s and peaked at 1.7 million in fiscal 2000 . After reaching somewhat lower levels for 2001 - 2007 , apprehensions fell dramatically from 2007 to 2011 . In 2012 , the number of unauthorized immigrants apprehended at the Mexican border rose modestly , to 365,000 , but only because of growing apprehensions of non-Mexicans ; apprehensions of Mexicans continued to decline .
Americans ages 65 and older are about three times as likely as adults under 30 to say they 're following the news about the candidates very closely ( 39 % vs. 12 % ) . And white adults ( 26 % ) are more likely than black and Hispanic Americans to say this ( 17 % and 16 % , respectively ) .
Finer differences emerge in which sites share news users . Looking at sites that share at least 25 % of their news users with another site , audience overlap most commonly exists among news users of smaller sites who also visit Facebook and/or YouTube for news , the two sites with the most news users overall . About half or more news users of each of the other sites studied also get news on Facebook , while about a quarter or more overlap on YouTube . Four of the sites have considerable overlap with Twitter : Roughly a third or more of news users of Instagram , Snapchat , LinkedIn and Reddit also get news on Twitter . Beyond Facebook , YouTube and Twitter , there is less widespread overlap in news use with the other sites . However , news users of Instagram and Snapchat have considerable overlap with each other , and at least a third of WhatsApp news users also get news from both of these sites , even though a relatively small share of the population uses these sites for news . Only a small portion ( less than 25 % ) of any of these sites ' news users also gets news from Reddit , LinkedIn , WhatsApp or Tumblr .
In the Asia/Pacific region , opinion is mixed . Favorable opinion of China ranges from a high of 64 % in Australia to a low of 10 % in Vietnam . In Australia , positive views of China have increased 12 percentage points in just the past year ( as favorable views of the U.S. have declined 12 points ) . But favorable opinions of China have also fallen over the past two years in Vietnam ( -9 points ) and Indonesia ( -8 ) . Additionally , China 's ratings have slowly declined in most Asian countries surveyed . For example , 55 % in Japan had a positive rating of their Asian neighbor in 2002 , but now only 13 % do , despite a rise in Japan in favorability towards China after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami .
A 14-nation survey by the Pew Research Center 's Global Attitudes Project , conducted Aug. 27 through Sept. 24 , finds Americans expressing the greatest concerns about the Taliban regaining control of Afghanistan : roughly three-in-four ( 76 % ) say that this would be a major threat to the well-being of the U.S . However , solid majorities throughout Western Europe also see this as a major threat to their nations , including 72 % of Italians and at least six-in-ten in France ( 66 % ) , Germany ( 65 % ) , Spain ( 64 % ) and Britain ( 60 % ) . Concern is also shared about the potential danger from a Pakistan controlled by extremists . More than six-in-ten Italian ( 68 % ) , French ( 67 % ) , British ( 65 % ) and American ( 64 % ) respondents say this would be a major threat to their countries . Slightly smaller majorities hold this view in Spain ( 59 % ) and Germany ( 57 % ) .
Despite their relatively secular worldview , Lebanese Muslims are among the most supportive of terrorist acts in the name of Islam . In 2005 , 39 % said suicide bombing and other forms of violence against civilians are often or sometimes justified in order to defend Islam from its enemies . Only Jordan , at 57 % , registered more support for suicide attacks . In Morocco , Turkey , and Indonesia , fewer than one-in-five Muslims believe such attacks can often or sometimes be justified .
In a survey of attitudes about government conducted last fall , just 37 % of Millennials said they had `` quite a lot of confidence '' in the future of the United States , compared with 45 % of Gen Xers , 49 % of Boomers and 56 % of the Silent Generation . Two decades ago , Gen Xers , then in their teens and 20s , stood out for their lack of confidence in the nation 's future . In 1994 , just 30 % of Gen Xers said they had quite a lot of confidence in the future of the U.S . Among older generations at the time – Boomers and Silents – half or more had a lot of confidence in the nation 's future . And two decades before that , Boomers were less bullish than their elders in assessing the nation 's future . In 1975 , when Boomers were the youngest generation , 49 % had a great deal of confidence in the future of the U.S. , compared with 62 % of Silents and 67 % of the Greatest Generation .
Since 2008 , perceptions of local job conditions have followed a fairly similar trajectory as views of the national economy . Currently 41 % say there are plenty of jobs available in their community , while 53 % say jobs are difficult to find .
In 2015 , about 4.9 million people born in the UK lived in other countries , the 10th-largest emigrant population in the world . Overall , about 8 % of those born in the UK live outside its borders . By contrast , only about 1 % of those born in the U.S. live outside of the United States . Among the 10 countries with the highest number of emigrants , the UK is the only Western European country to appear on the list . Other top origin countries of emigrants include India ( 15.6 million ) , Mexico ( 12.3 million ) and Russia ( 10.6 million ) .
The increased prevalence of living with mom and/or dad is more prominent among less-educated young adults . In 2016 , only 10 % of Millennials who had completed at least a bachelor 's degree lived at home , compared with 7 % of college-educated Gen Xers who lived at home in 2000 . By contrast , 20 % of young adults with no more than a high school diploma lived in their parents ' home in 2016 , up from 12 % of Gen Xers in 2000 .
The weekly News Interest Index survey was being conducted when the Jan. 8 shootings in Tucson occurred . Before the rampage , Americans said they were tracking news about the economy most closely , but in the survey 's fourth and final day – the Sunday following the horrific events in Arizona – 34 % said they were following news about the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords most closely , double the 17 % that said they were following news about the economy most closely .
Catholics and Protestants also express varying levels of confidence in their clergy 's advice about personal issues and religious topics . Only three-in-ten Catholics , for instance , say they have `` a lot '' of confidence in their clergy 's guidance about marriage and relationships . Larger shares of evangelical Protestants ( 66 % ) , Protestants in the historically black tradition ( 54 % ) and mainline Protestants ( 45 % ) say the same . And Catholics are much less likely than Protestants overall to trust their religious leaders to give useful advice on parenting ( 23 % vs. 49 % , respectively ) . However , both Protestants and Catholics express fairly low levels of confidence in their clergy to provide guidance on political topics such as abortion , immigration and global climate change . While Pope Francis regularly speaks about immigration and climate change , small shares of Catholic Mass-goers have a lot of confidence in their clergy 's guidance on immigration ( 16 % ) and global climate change ( 8 % ) . Among Protestants , one-in-five or fewer have a lot of confidence in their clergy to provide guidance on these issues .
While social networking has spread globally , it is particularly widespread in the country where it began . Among the 22 publics surveyed , Americans most often say they use websites like Facebook and MySpace : 46 % use such sites ; 36 % use the internet , but do not access these sites ; and 18 % say they never go online . The survey finds three countries close behind the United States in social network usage : in Poland ( 43 % ) , Britain ( 43 % ) and South Korea ( 40 % ) , at least four-in-ten adults say they use such sites . And at least a third engage in social networking in France ( 36 % ) , Spain ( 34 % ) , Russia ( 33 % ) and Brazil ( 33 % ) . Germans and the Japanese stand out among highly connected publics for their comparatively low levels of participation in social networking . While 31 % of Germans use these types of sites , 49 % go online at least occasionally but choose not to use them . In Japan , 24 % are engaged in social networking , while 44 % have internet access but are not engaged .
For adults with Hispanic ancestry who do not self-identify as Hispanic , 81 % say they have never considered themselves Hispanic or Latino . The reasons for this are many and are often linked to mixed backgrounds , limited contact with Hispanic relatives and few Hispanic cultural links , according to a follow-up open-ended question . For example , some 27 % said they do not consider themselves Hispanic because they have a mixed Hispanic and non-Hispanic background or that their Hispanic ancestry is too distant . Another 16 % said they do not consider themselves Hispanic despite their Hispanic ancestry because of their upbringing or that they have little contact with their Hispanic relatives ; 15 % said the reason they say they are not Hispanic is because they do not speak Spanish or have no link to Hispanic culture ; 12 % said they do not look Hispanic or they identify as another race ; and 9 % said they were born in the U.S. and consider themselves American .
Currently , 53 % disapprove of the health care law , while 42 % approve . This is among the most negative assessments of the law since it was enacted in March 2010 . In July 2012 , shortly after the Supreme Court upheld most of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act , 47 % approved of the legislation and 43 % disapproved . Overall opinion about the health care law has fluctuated in recent years , yet the patterns of opposition and support across demographic and partisan groups have remained fairly steady since the legislation was first being debated in Congress .
The majority of Baby Boomers ( U.S. adults born 1946 to 1964 ) are still in the labor force , and the oldest among them are staying in the labor force at the highest annual rate for people their age in more than half a century . In 2018 , 29 % of Boomers ages 65 to 72 were working or looking for work , outpacing the labor market engagement of the Silent Generation ( 21 % ) and the Greatest Generation ( 19 % ) when they were the same age , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of official labor force data . Between 2011 ( when the oldest Baby Boomer reached age 65 ) and 2029 ( when the youngest Boomer turns age 65 ) , roughly 3.8 million Boomers are expected to turn 65 each year , or about 10,000 daily . However , in part because of older Boomers ' robust participation rates , 10,000 Boomers are not exiting the labor force every day . Rather , the Boomer labor force has been declining by 2.2 million on average each year since 2010 , or about 5,900 daily .
The survey finds that the public gives positive marks to Trump on keeping his promises ( 60 % say he does this ) and his ability to get things done ( 54 % ) . However , on seven other traits and characteristics – ranging from his temperament to whether he is a good manager – he is viewed more negatively .
Older Americans are the most likely to see the outbreak as a major threat to their health and the least likely to see it as a threat to their personal financial situation . About half ( 49 % ) of those 65 and older said in a late April-early May survey that the coronavirus is a major threat to their health . But fewer in this age group – 32 % – say it is a major threat to their personal finances .
Overall , 55 % say they disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job as president , compared with 38 % who say they approve of his job performance . Trump 's approval ratings are little changed since June and have been remarkably stable over the first year and a half of his administration . Over this period , Trump 's ratings have shown much less change than his predecessors .
Nearly two-thirds of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents ( 65 % ) say they would prefer to live in a community where houses are larger and farther apart , but schools , stores and restaurants are several miles away . By contrast , a majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 58 % ) would rather live in a community in which houses are smaller and closer to each other , but schools , stores and restaurants are in walking distance . The ideological differences in community preferences are stark , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in September among 9,895 U.S. adults . Conservative Republicans are about twice as likely as liberal Democrats to prefer a community where the houses are larger and more widely spaced ( 71 % vs. 35 % ) . These overall patterns of opinion are little changed from 2017 . A majority of rural residents ( 69 % ) say they would rather live in a community with larger houses that are farther apart , while 60 % of urban residents prefer communities with small houses . People who live in suburbs are more evenly divided .
Obama and Romney have switched places in poll results over the final two months of the campaign . This chart tracks likely voters , based on national polls conducted by Pew Research Center . Read Pew Research 's final estimate for Election Day , which allocates a portion of the undecided voters to each candidate here .
A majority of Americans support the renewal of diplomatic relations with Cuba . A Pew Research Center survey from July 2015 found that 73 % of Americans approved of the thaw in relations between the two countries . A similar share also said they would favor ending the trade embargo the U.S. imposed against Cuba in 1960 . Support for renewed diplomatic and economic relations had increased across nearly all partisan groups since January 2015 , the month after Obama announced his initiative .
As the share of Hispanics who speak Spanish falls , the share that speaks only English at home is expected to rise . About a third ( 34 % ) of Hispanics will speak only English at home by 2020 , up from 25 % in 2010 , according to Ortman and Shin .
Many workers report that their employers have policies about social media use on the job , or about how employees may present themselves in various online spaces . Half of all full-time and part-time workers ( 51 % ) say their workplace has rules about using social media while at work ( 45 % say their employer does not have these policies ) , while 32 % report that their employer has policies about how employees may present themselves on the internet in general ( 63 % say their employer does not have these policies ) . Policies that regulate how employers present themselves online outside of work may be expected to influence whether these workers use social media at all . However , this does not seem to be the case : Fully 77 % of workers report using social media regardless of whether their employer has such a policy in place .
There is little support across European publics to allow more immigrants to move to their countries . A median of 51 % across the European countries surveyed believe their country should allow fewer immigrants into their country or none at all . Publics are somewhat divided over the impact of immigration on crime , but a median of 57 % say that immigration increases the risk of terrorism and a median of 51 % say immigrants want to remain distinct from the broader society . However , a median of 53 % say that migrants make the country stronger through their hard work and talents .
A record 33.2 million Hispanics in the U.S. speak English proficiently , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data . In 2013 , this group made up 68 % of all Hispanics ages 5 and older , up from 59 % in 2000 . At the same time that the share of Latinos who speak English proficiently is growing , the share that speaks Spanish at home has been declining over the last 13 years . In 2013 , 73 % of Latinos ages 5 and older said they speak Spanish at home , down from 78 % who said the same in 2000 . Despite this decline , a record 35.8 million Hispanics speak Spanish at home , a number that has continued to increase as the nation 's Hispanic population has grown .
In France , Germany , Italy , Poland and the United Kingdom , a median of 51 % now give their economy a positive grade . This comes in the wake of an average 1.7 % growth in 2016 in the five European Union countries and an unemployment rate of 7.4 % . The public 's view of the economy is up from a low of 15 % across the five EU nations in 2013 , when their economies grew at an annual average of only 0.6 % and joblessness stood at 9.0 % . In 2007 , a median of 36 % in those countries said their economic situation was good . The modest but sustained economic recoveries in Australia , Canada , Europe , Japan and the U.S. since the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis have finally buoyed public spirits about economic conditions in those countries . A median of 51 % in the 17 advanced economies surveyed believes that their current economic situation is good , 45 % think it 's bad . Strong upbeat sentiment in northern Europe in particular offsets quite downbeat views in southern Europe and South Korea . Emerging market and developing economies have slowed in recent years , especially in key nations in Africa and Latin America , and public opinion in those societies reflects that slowdown . Only 45 % in the 15 emerging and developing markets surveyed voice the view that current economic conditions in their nation are good , 54 % believe they are bad . Positive views in India and the Philippines are offset by very negative sentiment in Venezuela and Brazil .
The NATO alliance commits each member to come to the collective defense of a member if it is attacked . During the confrontation with Russia over Ukraine last year , a majority of Americans ( 56 % ) were willing to fulfill this security commitment if Russia got into a serious military conflict with a NATO ally . But that finding masked a partisan divide : Nearly seven-in-ten Republicans ( 69 % ) , but only 47 % of Democrats , supported using force to aid a NATO ally attacked by Russia . Last year 's survey found that the U.S. and Canada were the only countries in which more than half of respondents backed using military force if Russia got into a serious conflict with a NATO ally . At least half of Germans , French and Italians said their countries should not use military force to defend a NATO ally if attacked by Russia . When it came specifically to aiding Ukraine , half or fewer in every NATO country surveyed supported the idea of the alliance sending arms to the Ukrainians .
Lebanon , Turkey and Jordan consistently have had low confidence in the U.S. president , regardless of who that was , over the past 15 years . Today , just 15 % in Lebanon , 11 % in Turkey and 9 % in Jordan have confidence in Trump .
Slightly more than a quarter ( 27 % ) say they heard a lot last week about CBS correspondent Lara Logan being attacked while covering events in Egypt . Another 42 % say they heard a little about this , while 31 % say they heard nothing at all . Women were more likely than men to say they heard a lot about this story ( 31 % vs. 22 % ) . About as many ( 26 % ) say they heard a lot about protests in Wisconsin over bargaining rights for government employee unions . A third ( 34 % ) say they heard a little about this , while 40 % say they heard nothing at all .
By a 56 % -35 % margin , a majority of Americans continues to oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally . These figures are largely unchanged over the past several years .
Americans continue to render extremely bleak assessments of economic conditions , both with respect to the national economy and their own financial situations . Fully 92 % of the public rates the national economy as only fair or poor , and a substantial majority ( 61 % ) judges their personal finances that way . Both measures are among the most negative recorded in Pew Research Center surveys over the past 15 years .
The rise in economic pessimism comes as Barack Obama 's job approval rating has declined . Currently , about as many approve ( 46 % ) as disapprove ( 45 % ) of Obama 's performance as president . In three previous surveys conducted after the killing of Osama bin Laden , far more had approved than disapproved . ( For more on changes in Obama 's job approval , see the detailed tables at the end of this report . )
Mobile technology has spread rapidly around the globe . Today , it is estimated that more than 5 billion people have mobile devices , and over half of these connections are smartphones . But the growth in mobile technology to date has not been equal , either across nations or within them . People in advanced economies are more likely to have mobile phones – smartphones in particular – and are more likely to use the internet and social media than people in emerging economies . For example , a median of 76 % across 18 advanced economies surveyed have smartphones , compared with a median of only 45 % in emerging economies .
However , there are significant partisan differences over how much the U.S. can learn from the international response . While 60 % of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say the U.S. can learn a great deal , just 28 % of Republicans and Republican leaners share that view .
Among the 47 countries included in the 2007 poll , China had the highest level of social trust : Almost eight-in-ten Chinese ( 79 % ) agreed with the statement `` Most people in this society are trustworthy . '' Although no other Asian nation matches China 's score , levels of trust are relatively high in the region , with majorities in Indonesia , Malaysia , Pakistan , and India saying most people in their respective countries can be trusted . Trust also tends to run low in the Middle East , Latin America , and Africa , although in all three regions substantial variation is seen . For instance , while nearly six-in-ten Egyptians ( 58 % ) believed most people can be trusted , only 27 % of Kuwaitis took this position . Similarly , in Latin America levels of trust ran from 51 % in Venezuela down to 28 % in Peru . Among African nations , Malians were roughly split between those who agree ( 49 % ) that most of their fellow citizens are trustworthy and those who disagree ( 51 % ) , while Kenyans , with 25 % agreeing and 75 % disagreeing , were much more pessimistic in this poll , which was conducted several months before the outbreak of violence that followed last December 's contested presidential election .
Latinos voted for President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney by 71 % to 27 % , according to an analysis of exit polls by the Pew Hispanic Center , a Project of the Pew Research Center . Obama 's national vote share among Hispanic voters is the highest seen by a Democratic candidate since 1996 , when President Bill Clinton won 72 % of the Hispanic vote .
Incomes of all households are higher today than they were in 1970 . Upper-income households saw the most growth , as their median income increased 43 % from 1970 to 2013 . Middle-income households gained 32 % over the same period , and the median income of lower-income households increased 28 % . ( All incomes are adjusted for household size . ) However , the overall gains mask a lengthy period – a lost decade , and then some – of losses from 2000 to 2013 . During this time , the median incomes of lower- , middle- and upper-income households have fallen by 9 % , 6 % and 6 % , respectively . Currently , the incomes of these households are comparable to what they were in 1997 .
In addition to asking people whether they might engage at all with a public health official during the COVID-19 outbreak , this survey explored another dimension of potential cooperation – comfort with sharing several pieces of relevant information within the contact tracing process . Before they answered this question , individuals were told : `` In ‘ contact tracing , ' public health officials interview people who have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in order to identify everyone who has had contact with them , and who are therefore at risk of getting COVID-19 . '' Individuals were asked about their comfort with sharing the names of people they may have been in physical contact with , places they have recently visited and location data from their cellphone .
Like U.S. adults overall , most Catholics said in the 2019 survey that they oppose overturning Roe v. Wade . Roughly two-thirds of Catholics ( 68 % ) said they do not want the Supreme Court to completely overturn the landmark decision , while almost three-in-ten ( 28 % ) said the ruling should be overturned . This gap was almost identical to the division in the U.S. public overall ( 70 % vs. 28 % ) . But opinions varied widely by religious affiliation : 89 % of unaffiliated Americans said Roe v. Wade should remain in place , compared with only 35 % of White evangelical Protestants .
In 2016 , many people across the nations polled say the U.S. is the world 's leading economic power . Australia stands out as the one nation polled where at least half ( 52 % ) say China is the top economy in the world , compared with 32 % who say it is the U.S . Relatively few respondents in these 16 nations think Japan or the countries of the European Union are the globe 's leading economic power , although 25 % of Germans say it is the EU countries .
On dealing with North Korea , Americans preferred sanctions , while opinion in Asia-Pacific differed by country . A majority of Americans ( 61 % ) said increasing economic sanctions is better than deepening ties with North Korea , the spring 2017 global survey found . Republicans ( 70 % ) and older Americans ( 69 % ) were more likely to prefer sanctions than Democrats ( 61 % ) and younger people ( 49 % ) . Attitudes diverged among Asia-Pacific countries on how best to deal with North Korea 's nuclear program . Half or more in Japan , South Korea and Australia backed stronger sanctions , while people in Vietnam and the Philippines leaned toward deepening ties with North Korea . ( However , many of those surveyed in Indonesia and Vietnam did not offer an opinion . )
Nearly a third ( 32 % ) of Democrats are what we call Solid Liberals , while about a fifth ( 21 % ) are part of what we call the Faith and Family Left — a somewhat more socially conservative group than Solid Liberals . Add in the younger , more economically moderate Next Generation Left ( 18 % ) and you have seven out of 10 Americans who identify with or incline toward the Democrats .
The public 's concerns about possible consequences from drone attacks also are little changed from two years ago . Overall , 48 % say they are very concerned that U.S. drone strikes endanger the lives of innocent civilians , while another 32 % say they are somewhat concerned about this . Earlier this year , two hostages , including one American , were killed by a U.S. drone strike targeting an al Qaeda compound along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border . The public expresses less concern over other potential consequences of U.S. drone attacks . About three-in-ten or fewer say they are very concerned U.S. strikes could lead to retaliation from extremist groups ( 31 % ) , that they are being conducted legally ( 29 % ) or that they could damage America 's reputation around the world ( 24 % ) .
Large majorities favored the federal government providing free medical care for those unable to pay ( 76 % ) , helping state and local governments cover the costs of medical care for mothers at childbirth ( 74 % ) , spending $ 25 million ( big bucks in those days ) to control venereal diseases ( 68 % ) , and giving loans on `` a long time and easy basis '' to enable tenant farmers to buy the farms they then rented ( 73 % ) .
Cell phones are pervasive in the region . In 2002 , roughly one-in-ten owned a mobile phone in Tanzania , Uganda , Kenya and Ghana . Since then , cell phone ownership has grown exponentially . Today , cell phones are as common in South Africa and Nigeria as they are in the United States . Smartphones ( those that can access the internet and applications ) are less widely used , though significant minorities own these devices in several nations , including 34 % of South Africans .
The debate in other EU member states about the future of the institution may just be getting started . A majority of the Greeks ( 68 % ) and pluralities of the Dutch ( 44 % ) , Germans ( 43 % ) , Italians ( 39 % ) and French ( 39 % ) all want some EU power returned to their national governments . Both the Dutch and the French have a history of holding referendums on major and not-so-major issues , and Euroskeptic parties in both countries have already voiced support for a public vote on their relationship with the EU .
Comparable percentages of Democrats ( 85 % ) and Republicans ( 81 % ) view their own party favorably , and members of both parties give very low ratings to the opposing party . More independents have a favorable impression of the Democratic Party ( 41 % ) than the Republican Party ( 33 % ) .
Younger Americans have long been less likely to read newspapers than their elders . But a Pew Research Center survey has revealed a significant twist , at least for certain newspapers with a more national focus : When we asked people if they regularly got news about the 2016 presidential election through either the print or online version of four specific U.S. newspapers , three of these papers – The New York Times , The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal – attracted more adults younger than 50 than 50 and older as regular readers . As for the fourth – USA Today – younger and older Americans regularly got election news there at about the same rate . Both The New York Times and The Washington Post were regular election news sources for about two-in-ten adults ages 18 - 29 and 30 - 49 , roughly twice the rate of older age groups . For The Wall Street Journal , 15 % of 18- to 29-year-olds and 12 % of 30- to 49-year-olds regularly got election news there , higher than those ages 65 and older ( 7 % ) , but about on par with 50- to 64-year-olds ( 8 % ) . All age groups were about equally likely to get election news from USA Today . Compared with these nationally focused newspapers , a very different picture emerges for local daily papers , of which there are more than a thousand in the U.S. About four-in-ten ( 43 % ) of those ages 65 and older regularly got news about the election from their local daily paper , which is around twice that of those 50 - 64 ( 24 % ) , and three or more times that of those younger ( 13 % of 30- to 49-year-olds and 10 % of those ages 18 - 29 ) . In fact , for adults younger than 50 , local daily papers were lower than or on par with any of the four national brands asked about , whereas for people 50 and older , local daily papers exceeded each of the national brands at least twofold .
The decline in international adoptions has been driven by a significant drop in adoptions from the five countries where most international adoptees were born : China ( which accounts for 78,257 of a total 267,098 adoptees from 1999 to 2016 ) , Russia ( 46,113 ) , Guatemala ( 29,805 ) , South Korea ( 20,318 ) and Ethiopia ( 15,317 ) . Together , these five countries have accounted for 71 % of all adoptions to the U.S. since 1999 , and they have driven 88 % of the total decline since 2004 . All five countries have revised their adoption protocols in recent years , making it more difficult for Americans to adopt from these countries . In Russia , a diplomatic rift with the U.S. led to a ban of new American adoptions of Russian children as of 2013 . In Guatemala , reports of fraud and corruption within the Guatemalan adoption system prompted the government to suspend new adoptions from the country in late 2007 . ( The few U.S. adoptions from Russia and Guatemala that occurred after the bans were `` transitional '' cases – adoptions initiated before the restrictions were in place . ) In China , South Korea and Ethiopia , the decrease in international adoption numbers reflects the tightening of domestic laws regarding adoptions in general . The Ethiopian government suspended all international adoptions in April .
While the overall share who are angry is unchanged , Republicans and Democrats have moved in opposite directions since 2015 . A year before the 2016 presidential election , one-third of Republicans said they were angry with the government , compared with about one-in-ten Democrats ( 11 % ) . About a year after Trump 's inauguration , the share of Republicans saying they were angry had declined to 19 % , while the share of Democrats saying this had increased to 29 % . Today , about one-third of Democrats ( 34 % ) say they are angry , compared with just 14 % of Republicans .
Four years after the recession officially ended , the economic recovery remains a long way off in the view of many Americans . A new survey by the Pew Research Center , conducted July 17 - 21 among 1,480 adults , finds that 44 % say it will be a long time before the nation 's economy recovers . Smaller percentages say either the economy already is recovering ( 28 % ) or will recover soon ( 26 % ) .
Most U.S. adults on Twitter report that they follow people with a mix of political views ( 37 % ) or that they do n't know the political views of the people they follow ( 34 % ) . A quarter ( 25 % ) say most of the people they follow on Twitter hold similar political views to their own , while just 4 % say that most of the people they follow have political views that are different from theirs . The above relationship – in which a majority of users follow either a mix of people with different beliefs or say they are n't sure of the political views of the people they follow – holds for the three types of Twitter users identified in this analysis ( political tweeters , nonpolitical tweeters and infrequent tweeters ) . Still , the share of Twitter users who say they follow people with political views similar to their own is much higher among those who tweet about national politics ( 38 % ) than it is among nonpolitical tweeters ( 17 % ) and those who tweet infrequently ( 20 % ) . In part , this dynamic is driven by the fact that nonpolitical tweeters ( 39 % ) and those who tweet infrequently ( 37 % ) are more likely than political tweeters ( 25 % ) to say they do n't know the political views of the people they follow . Democrats and Democratic leaners on Twitter are about twice as likely as Republican and Republican-leaning users to say that most of the people they follow hold similar political views to theirs ( 31 % vs. 15 % ) . A previous Pew Research Center report found that Democrats make up a larger share of all Twitter users than of the general public overall .
More than one-in-three American labor force participants ( 35 % ) are Millennials , making them the largest generation in the U.S. labor force , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data .
However , during those same four years the growth of the Latino vote continued to lag well behind the growth of the Latino population . This widening gap is driven by two key demographic trends : a high percentage of the new Hispanics in the population are either too young to vote or ineligible because they are not citizens ( Figure 1 ) .
In looking ahead to this fall 's elections , Republicans are more likely than Democrats to view a candidate 's position on the Affordable Care Act as very important to their vote . A new national survey finds that 64 % of Republican registered voters say a candidate 's stance on the health care law will be very important in their voting decision , compared with 52 % of Democrats and 45 % of independents .
Muslims are projected to be the world 's fastest-growing major religious group in the decades ahead . By 2035 , the number of babies born to Muslims is projected to modestly exceed births to Christians , mostly due to Muslims ' relatively young population and high fertility rates .
The share of Americans with a positive view of the federal government fell to 28 % in April , five points lower than the previous year , while public favorability of state government ticked up five points to 57 % . Fully 41 % of Democrats held favorable views of the federal government , compared with only 13 % of Republicans . By contrast , state and local governments are viewed favorably across party lines : 56 % of Democrats and 57 % of Republicans said they had a favorable opinion of their state government . But the partisan makeup of the state government matters : Republicans give more positive ratings to GOP-led state governments , while Democrats rate Democratic-led state governments more highly .
Three-in-ten Americans turn to 2016 presidential candidates ' digital messages for news and information about the election – and the candidates ' social media posts outpace their websites and emails as sources of this news . Roughly a quarter of U.S. adults ( 24 % ) turn to social media posts from either the Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump campaigns as a way of keeping up with the election ; this is a higher share than say they turn to the candidates ' campaign websites ( 10 % ) or emails ( 9 % ) . While all age groups rely more on campaign social media communications than their emails or websites , young adults are the most likely to do so : Nearly four-in-ten ( 37 % ) of those ages 18 to 29 turn to candidates ' social media accounts , compared with 28 % of those ages 30 to 49 , 19 % of those ages 50 to 64 , and 11 % of those age 65+ .
Among the 50.7 million Hispanics in the United States , nearly two-thirds ( 65 % ) , or 33 million , self-identify as being of Mexican origin , according to tabulations of the 2010 American Community Survey ( ACS ) by the Pew Hispanic Center , a project of the Pew Research Center . No other Hispanic subgroup rivals the size of the Mexican-origin population . Puerto Ricans , the nation 's second largest Hispanic origin group , make up just 9 % of the total Hispanic population in the 50 states and the District of Columbia .
A plurality of Americans ( 41 % ) say news organizations are giving the right amount of coverage to possible candidates for the 2012 elections , while 29 % say they are giving too much coverage to election news . That is up slightly from 22 % in April . Another 16 % say the press is giving too little coverage to the candidates . Pluralities also say news organizations are giving the right amount of coverage to the situation in Afghanistan ( 42 % ) and news about the federal budget deficit and national debt ( 44 % ) . Relatively few see either story receiving too much coverage ( 12 % Afghanistan , 11 % federal budget deficit and national debt . )
Elsewhere in the region , the 2007 survey found little confidence in Chavez to do the right thing in world affairs among the Latin American countries surveyed . In fact , fewer than one-in-five said they have confidence in Chavez 's ability as a global leader in Brazil ( 17 % ) , Mexico ( 17 % ) , Peru ( 15 % ) and Chile ( 14 % ) . Even in the country led by one of Chavez 's closest allies — Bolivia 's Evo Morales — only one-third expressed confidence in the Venezuelan leader . Opinions about Chavez were more mixed in Argentina , where nearly as many expressed confidence as lacked confidence ( 40 % vs. 43 % , respectively ) .
About half of the public ( 46 % ) says the U.S. Supreme Court should make its rulings based on its understanding of what the Constitution `` meant as it was originally written , '' while an identical share says the court should base its rulings on what the Constitution `` means in current times , '' according to a survey conducted in October . Public opinion about this issue has changed little in recent years .
The results , included in the University of Georgia 's `` Annual Survey of Journalism and Mass Communication Graduates '' reveal that just 55.5 % of 2009 journalism and communication graduates with a bachelor degree were able to find full-time work within a year of leaving school . That is down 4.9 percentage points from the year before and stands in stark contrast with the 70.2 % of graduates who found work as recently as 2007 . The most recent masters degree recipients fared little better , with their employment rate dropping to 61.9 % from 65.4 % in 2008 . This daunting job market was further compounded by stagnating salaries and eroding benefits , according to the survey . The median annual wage for full-time employed 2009 bachelor degree recipients again stood at $ 30,000 , the same number it has been since 2006 , although inflation edged up in the past year . At the same time , benefits continued to be cut across the board , with only 52.9 % of the 2009 employed grads receiving major medical coverage at work compared with 59.2 % the previous year . Dental coverage fell from 56.7 % to 50.3 % , and life insurance benefits dropped from 49.1 % to 41.7 % .
Overall , concerns about global poverty trail worries about the overall global economy . A median of 53 % say that global poverty poses a major threat to their country . The French and Spanish show the greatest concern , with about three-quarters in each country describing global poverty as a major threat .
About two-in-ten ( 22 % ) of the public say they very closely followed news about proposals for stricter regulation of banks and financial institutions ; 4 % say they followed this news most closely . The debate over new financial regulations accounted for 5 % of coverage . Just 7 % very closely followed news about the government crackdown on protesters in Thailand . This story accounted for 2 % of coverage .
President Vladimir Putin 's handling of foreign affairs gets high ratings from most Russians , in contrast to more tempered views of his economic policies and anti-corruption efforts at home . Confidence in Putin 's global leadership has been consistently strong over the decade-and-a-half that Pew Research Center has polled in Russia . Trust in the Russian leader has remained high since an increase in 2014 , shortly after the conflict with Ukraine and subsequent annexation of Crimea . Despite slippage in how well the public thinks their president is handling key foreign policies , a majority of Russians say their country plays a more important role on the world stage than it did 10 years ago .
Health care : About seven-in-ten Americans ( 69 % ) said reducing health care costs should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year . This reflects an 8-percentage-point increase from 2011 , though is little changed from last year . Majorities in both parties placed priority on health care , though a larger share of Democrats ( 77 % ) than Republicans ( 59 % ) cited health care costs as a top priority . In the post-midterm survey , Democrats in Congress had a 23-point advantage over Trump in the public 's assessments of who 'd have the better approach to health care ( 51 % vs. 28 % ) .
A search of the LexisNexis database of 15 of the nation 's largest newspapers from Jan. 1-Sept. 27 , 2013 , identified 335 stories that talked about the 2016 campaign . That is more than double the coverage the 2012 campaign received ( 132 stories ) during the first nine months in 2009 . One reason for lighter coverage four years ago was that the 2012 election featured an incumbent president with no significant challengers within his party , so attention was focused almost solely on the Republican side .
African Americans are more religious than whites and Latinos by many measures of religious commitment . For instance , three-quarters of black Americans say religion is very important in their lives , compared with smaller shares of whites ( 49 % ) and Hispanics ( 59 % ) ; African Americans also are more likely to attend services at least once a week and to pray regularly . Black Americans ( 83 % ) are more likely to say they believe in God with absolute certainty than whites ( 61 % ) and Latinos ( 59 % ) .
The median household incomes of white , black , Hispanic and Asian households did not statistically change from 2011 to 2012 . As the recent Pew Research report on Martin Luther King Jr. 's elusive dream noted , the gap in median income between white and black households has not changed much over the decades . In 1972 , white incomes were 1.7 times black incomes . White and black incomes have both risen since then and in 2012 white incomes were 1.7 times black incomes . The white-to-Hispanic income gap has risen since 1972 , from 1.3 in 1972 to 1.5 in 2012 . The Census Bureau has tracked Asian household incomes since 1987 . In 1987 white incomes were about 88 % of the typical Asian household . By 2012 , whites incomes were 83 % of Asian incomes . These household income figures from the Census are not adjusted for variance in household size . Asian-Americans tend to have more people living in their households than do other race groups , which may account for some of the gap in median income .
Teens are divided on whether they spend too much or too little time playing video games . A quarter of teens ( 26 % ) believe they spend too much time playing video games , while a similar share ( 22 % ) feels they spend too little time doing so . And as with video game playing in general , these findings differ by gender . Four-in-ten boys ages 13 to 17 ( 41 % ) say they spend too much time playing video games , nearly four times the share of girls who say the same ( 11 % ) . And a larger share of boys ( 65 % ) than girls ( 50 % ) have cut back on the amount of time they spend playing games . Three-in-ten girls believe they spend too little time playing games , a view shared by just 14 % of boys .
The Chinese also subscribe to negative stereotypes of the Japanese . Seven-in-ten or more Chinese associate violence ( 74 % ) and arrogance ( 70 % ) with the Japanese . The former view is up 9 percentage points since 2006 . Only half the Chinese see the Japanese as modern , down from roughly two-thirds a decade ago . And the proportion of Chinese ( 34 % ) who see the Japanese as hardworking has nearly halved since 2006 ( 61 % ) . As a point of comparison , in a 2015 Pew Research Center survey , 94 % of Americans believed the Japanese to be hardworking .
Democrats maintained a large edge among Latinos voting in Tuesday 's midterm elections , but in some states , Republican candidates won more than 40 % of the Latino vote , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of National Election Pool exit poll data as reported by NBC News . Though Democrats comfortably won the Latino vote in nearly all states that had key Senate or gubernatorial races ( and for which exit poll data is available ) , Republican candidates won many of those contests , and will take control of the U.S. Senate for the first time since 2007 . In congressional races nationally , Democrats won the Latino vote by a margin of 62 % to 36 % . This is comparable to the last midterm cycle four years ago when six-in-ten ( 60 % ) Latinos voted for a Democratic candidate , but down from 2012 when Democrats took 68 % of the Latino vote . By comparison , Republicans won the white vote by a nearly as wide a margin — 60 % to 38 % , essentially unchanged from 2010 and 2012 . Among black voters , 89 % voted for the Democratic candidate in their local congressional election while 10 % supported the Republican . This is unchanged from 2010 . In 2012 , 91 % of black voters supported Democrats and 8 % backed Republicans .
The January 2014 survey , conducted just after the 2013 holiday gift-giving season , produced evidence that e-book reading devices are spreading through the population . Some 42 % of adults now own tablet computers , up from 34 % in September . And the number of adults who own an e-book reading device like a Kindle or Nook reader jumped from 24 % in September to 32 % after the holidays . Overall , 50 % of Americans now have a dedicated handheld device–either a tablet computer like an iPad , or an e-reader such as a Kindle or Nook–for reading e-content . That figure has grown from 43 % of adults who had either of those devices in September .
Perhaps surprisingly , not very many people earn minimum wage , and they make up a smaller share of the workforce than they used to . According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , last year 1.532 million hourly workers earned the federal minimum of $ 7.25 an hour ; nearly 1.8 million more earned less than that because they fell under one of several exemptions ( tipped employees , full-time students , certain disabled workers and others ) , for a total of 3.3 million hourly workers at or below the federal minimum .
Majorities in most of the Muslim publics surveyed express concerns about Islamic extremism in their country . Senegalese Muslims are the most worried ( 75 % concerned ) , but at least six-in-ten Muslims in Lebanon , Tunisia , Malaysia , Nigeria , Pakistan , Egypt and the Palestinian territories are also concerned . More Jordanian Muslims ( 54 % ) see Islamic extremism as a threat than do not ( 45 % ) .
Obama 's Standing – Historically , second term presidencies are often full of surprises and many of them unpleasant . Absent a surprise , so far , public opinion on Obama is running ahead of George W. Bush , but behind where both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton , whose unexpected troubles revealed themselves two years into their second term .
The public 's increasingly grim views of the economy are reflected in assessments of the country 's overall direction . Just 22 % of Americans are satisfied with the way things are going in the country , the lowest percentage observed in any Pew Research Center survey since the fall of 1993 .
By contrast , the religious `` nones '' – those who are religiously unaffiliated – overwhelmingly support legal abortion . Roughly three-quarters ( 74 % ) say it should be legal in all or most cases , while just 21 % say it should be illegal . A large majority of white mainline Protestants ( 67 % ) also say abortion should be legal .
Knowledge of QAnon grew on both sides of the political aisle , though Democrats ' awareness continues to outpace that of Republicans . As of September , more than half ( 55 % ) of Democrats and those who lean Democratic say they have heard at least a little about the conspiracy theories , compared with 39 % of Republicans .
Atheists and agnostics know more about religion than most other religious groups , while people who identify as `` nothing in particular '' are among the least knowledgeable . Out of 32 multiple-choice questions on the survey , atheists and agnostics get more than half right , on average ( 17.9 and 17.0 questions correct , respectively ) , while those who say their religion is `` nothing in particular '' get about a third correct ( 11.4 questions ) . This means that atheists and agnostics are among the highest scorers on the survey – along with Jews and evangelical Protestants – while those who say their religion is `` nothing in particular '' have some of the lowest scores . Americans overall get an average of 14.2 out of 32 questions right .
Cell phones are owned by overwhelmingly large majorities of people in most major countries around the world , and they are used for much more than just phone calls . In particular , text messaging is a global phenomenon – across the 21 countries surveyed , a median of 75 % of cell phone owners say they text .
Just 29 % of Americans say that news organizations generally get the facts straight , while 63 % say that news stories are often inaccurate . In the initial survey in this series about the news media 's performance in 1985 , 55 % said news stories were accurate while 34 % said they were inaccurate . That percentage had fallen sharply by the late 1990s and has remained low over the last decade .
And carpooling , at least as a way to get to and from work , has fallen over the decades – from 20 % of workers in 1980 to 9 % last year , according to the Census Bureau . Around three-quarters ( 76 % ) of Americans typically drove alone last year , as they have every year since at least 2000 .
Large majorities of Democrats ( 81 % ) and independents ( 69 % ) favor a compromise to avoid default , but Republicans are more divided : 53 % favor a compromise , while 38 % say lawmakers who share their views should stand by their principles even if it leads to a default . Among all Republicans and Republican-leaning independents , 53 % of those who agree with the Tea Party favor lawmakers standing by their principles even if it means the government goes into default . Just 24 % of Republicans and GOP leaners who do not agree with the Tea Party express this view .
Regardless of people 's intention to get vaccinated , 62 % of Americans report they would be uncomfortable being among the first to do so . Roughly two-thirds of those who say they would `` probably '' be vaccinated are uncomfortable being among the first as are nearly all of those who say they would not be vaccinated if a vaccine were available today . The exception comes from the roughly three-in-ten U.S. adults ( 29 % ) who say they would definitely be vaccinated ; 82 % of this group say they would be comfortable being in the first groups to be immunized against coronavirus .
Hillary Clinton led Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination in every Pew Research Center survey conducted throughout the party 's primaries . But many Democratic voters vacillated in their candidate support throughout this period . Even as Clinton led throughout , the share of voters who remained consistently loyal to her over the course of the election was far smaller than her overall support in any single survey . By April 2016 , near the end of the Democratic primaries , Clinton was named the first choice of 46 % of Democratic voters in an open-ended question about their nomination preferences . But only 29 % had consistently named her their first choice in December 2015 , March 2016 and April 2016 . And even fewer , just 15 % , had consistently named her their first choice going all the way back to March 2015 . This fluidity was n't confined to Clinton supporters : Sanders was the top choice of 37 % of Democratic voters in April 2016 , but only about half of these supporters ( 20 % of all Democratic voters ) consistently backed Sanders across the three primary-season surveys . Fully 44 % of Democratic voters changed their preferences at least once in the surveys conducted over this four-month period , including those who may have been undecided at some point .
Republicans see more risk than Democrats when it comes to the economic effects of climate policies . Around half of Republicans ( 52 % ) said in 2019 that such policies hurt the economy . In contrast , most Democrats said climate policies either help ( 47 % ) or make no difference ( 38 % ) to the economy .
A large majority of Republican and Republican-leaning independents ( 72 % ) say Trump has a great deal or a fair amount of respect for the nation 's democratic institutions . By contrast , just 14 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners say Trump has a great deal or a fair amount of respect for the nation 's institutions . Overwhelmingly , Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 86 % ) say that Trump has little or no respect for the country 's institutions and traditions .
The survey asked teens to rank the types of contact information they would most commonly share with a new friend . About half of teens ( 52 % ) told us that a phone number for calling is one of the first three types of information they would share , but only 9 % say this is the first contact information they would exchange . By comparison , 80 % of teens share their phone number for texting with a new friend , and 54 % say it is the first thing they would give to a new friend .
By a ratio of nearly four-to-one , adults in this country say that American parents are placing too little ( 56 % ) rather than too much ( 15 % ) pressure on students , with the remaining quarter ( 24 % ) saying that parents are exerting the right amount of pressure . Parents and non-parents feel roughly the same way about this question , the survey finds . So do Republicans and Democrats , blacks and whites , older adults and younger adults , people with low incomes and those with high incomes , and people with college degrees and those with a just a high school education or less . The only demographic gap in attitudes about this question — and it 's not especially wide — comes on the gender front . More men ( 62 % ) than women ( 51 % ) say parents are n't being tough enough .
As efforts to stop a major underwater oil leak faltered and President Obama traveled to Louisiana to assess the early damage , the crisis in the Gulf of Mexico grabbed public attention and dominated media coverage last week . More than half of Americans ( 55 % ) say they followed news about the oil leak very closely . Close to six-in-ten ( 58 % ) say they followed this news more closely than any other major story , according to the latest News Interest Index survey , conducted May 27 - 30 among 1,001 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press . One week earlier , 47 % said they were following news about the leak very closely .
Turks are also divided in their evaluations of current economic conditions in their country . Half say the economy is good and a nearly equal 46 % say the economy is bad . As with views of the country 's direction overall , the public has been divided over the state of the economy in recent years . Prior to 2011 , however , economic ratings were dismal , especially following the 2008 - 2009 worldwide financial crisis . Furthermore , AKP supporters , rural Turks , and more devout Muslims are generally happier with current economic conditions . Turks are slightly optimistic about their economic prospects over the next year . Roughly four-in-ten say the economy will improve , three-in-ten say it will get worse , and around a quarter ( 24 % ) say economic conditions will remain the same .
Most Christians in the United States ( 63 % ) say that whether someone is a man or a woman is determined by their sex at birth . Among religious `` nones '' – those who identify religiously as atheist , agnostic or `` nothing in particular '' – about six-in-ten ( 62 % ) say they think a person 's gender is not necessarily determined by the sex they are assigned at birth .
The recent price increases also come at a time of continued interest in the health of the U.S. economy ; 14 % say they followed news about the economy most closely last week . Not including news about budget fights at the state and federal levels , news about the economy accounted for 3 % of the newshole . Fewer say they very closely followed news about a deadly earthquake in New Zealand ( 20 % ) or recent developments in the debate over gay marriage ( 19 % ) . Five percent say they followed news about the earthquake more closely than any other top story , while 4 % say they followed news about gay marriage developments that closely . Each of these stories accounted for 4 % of coverage last week , according to PEJ .
Here , again , people in France and the UK are notably pessimistic . In both countries , as well as in Spain , about three-quarters of adults or more say children today will be worse off financially than their parents , even though all three countries saw average annual GDP growth rates between 1 % and 2 % between 2003 and 2018 .
Six percent of online adults are reddit users,1 according to a nationally representative survey by the Pew Research Center 's Internet & American Life Project . This is our first survey that specifically examines reddit as a standalone platform , and it finds that young men are especially likely to visit the site . Some 15 % of male internet users ages 18 - 29 say that they use reddit , compared with 5 % of women in the same age range and 8 % of men ages 30 - 49 .
Bisexual adults are much less likely than gays and lesbians to be `` out '' to the important people in their lives , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of recently released survey data from Stanford University . Only 19 % of those who identify as bisexual say all or most of the important people in their lives are aware of their sexual orientation . In contrast , 75 % of gay and lesbian adults say the same . About one-quarter of bisexual adults ( 26 % ) are not `` out '' to any of the important people in their lives , compared with 4 % of gay and lesbian adults . Roughly half of those who are bisexual ( 54 % ) are out to some or only a few people .
The heightened Democratic enthusiasm is particularly notable among liberal Democrats , 53 % of whom are more interested in voting this year than usual . The partisan gap in enthusiasm is even visible among independents – those who lean Democratic are considerably more eager to vote than those who lean Republican . Overall , 47 % of voters who plan to vote Democratic this fall say they are more enthusiastic about voting than usual , compared with just 30 % of voters who plan to vote Republican . The higher level of enthusiasm among Democratic voters is linked to two underlying attitudes : anger at the president and optimism about Democrats chances in the fall . Nearly two-thirds ( 64 % ) of those who plan to vote for the Democratic candidate in their district think of their vote this fall as a vote against George W. Bush . These anti-Bush voters are significantly more motivated to vote – 52 % say they are more eager to vote this year than usual , compared with 39 % among those who say Bush is not a factor in their vote . Democratic voters also have an optimistic outlook for the fall – 64 % think the party will do better in this year 's congressional elections than it has in other recent elections . The heightened expectations among Democrats are strongly linked with increased interest in voting . More than half ( 55 % ) of Democratic voters who expect the party to make progress in the fall say they are more enthusiastic about voting this year , compared with just 34 % who see the party doing about the same – or worse – as in recent elections .
There are more modest differences by gender and race and ethnicity . Women are more likely than men to say they regularly use these devices ( 25 % vs. 18 % ) . Hispanic adults are more likely than whites to report regularly wearing a fitness tracker ( 26 % vs. 20 % ) , while black adults fall in between at 23 % .
These are among the findings of a new survey by Pew Research Center , conducted March 3 to 29 , 2020 , among 1,000 adults in the U.S . The survey also finds that younger people , who have historically been more positive than older Americans toward China , now increasingly hold negative views of the country and are more prone to see it as a threat to the U.S. than in previous years . Older Americans , however , still take a more negative stance than their younger compatriots on most aspects of the U.S.-China relationship . Older Americans , those ages 50 and older , are more likely than those ages 18 to 29 to have unfavorable views of China . This has been the case every year since the Center first asked the question 15 years ago . But while half or more of those 50 and older have held negative views of China since 2012 , this is the first year in which more than half of younger Americans also have an unfavorable opinion . Among this age group , negative views have roughly doubled since the question was first asked .
A majority of Americans ( 57 % ) say they know only some of their neighbors ; far fewer ( 26 % ) say they know most of them . Americans ages 65 and older are more likely than those ages 18 to 29 to say they know most of their neighbors ( 34 % vs. 20 % ) . In contrast , about a quarter ( 23 % ) of adults under 30 do n't know any of their neighbors , compared with just 4 % among those 65 and older .
Conservative Republicans are much more likely than any other group to say that the most positive thing the media do is report the news ; 41 % said this , at least 12 percentage points higher than any other group . Nearly four-in-ten liberal Democrats ( 38 % ) , on the other hand , highlight the public service aspect of the news media , about twice the share of conservative Republicans ( 18 % ) and higher than any other group .
The recent passage of several highly restrictive abortion bills in Alabama , Georgia , Ohio and Missouri has led to increased speculation about the future of abortion access in the United States . When asked about the future of abortion last December – before these states acted – about three-in-four Americans said that , in 2050 , abortion will either be legal but with some restrictions ( 55 % ) or legal with no restrictions ( 22 % ) , a Pew Research Center survey found . About one-in-five said abortion will be illegal 30 years from now , with 16 % saying it will be illegal except in certain cases and 5 % saying it will be illegal with no exceptions .
The improvement in the Republican Party 's favorability rating is most pronounced among independents who lean toward the GOP . In the wake of Trump 's victory , about seven-in-ten Republican leaners ( 72 % ) have a favorable opinion of the GOP , which is up 15 points since October and 29 points since April . Republicans are about as favorable toward their party today ( 83 % ) as they were in October ( 82 % ) , though ratings have improved 15 points since the spring . Democratic views of the GOP have also ticked more positive than in recent months , though just 20 % of Democrats and 27 % of Democratic leaners view the Republican Party favorably . While overall ratings of the Democratic Party are unchanged since the fall , there have been shifts in views among subgroups over this period . Favorable views of the Democratic Party are down slightly among Democrats ( 88 % today , from 94 % in October ) , but they are unchanged among Democratic leaners . Both Republicans ( up 8 points ) and Republican leaners ( up 9 points ) are somewhat more likely to rate the Democratic Party favorably today than they were in October .
Among Republicans and Republican leaners , views are more mixed . Half say he has changed the nature of political debate in the country for the better , while 28 % say he has n't changed it much and 21 % say he 's changed it for the worse . There is a significant divide in views on this question among Republicans by ideology . Far more conservative Republicans say Trump has changed U.S. political debate for the better than for the worse ( 61 % vs. 12 % ) . By contrast , moderate and liberal Republicans are about as likely to say he 's changed debate for the worse ( 35 % ) as for the better ( 33 % ) .
Though one of the newer online activities the Pew Internet Project studies,35 as of 2011 social networking sites are used by 65 % of all internet users—half of all American adults .36 Among internet users , we see a very strong correlation in use with age , as some 87 % of internet users under 30 use these sites , compared with less than a third ( 29 % ) of those 65 and older . However , though their overall numbers are still relatively low , older adults have represented one of the fastest-growing segments of the social networking site-using population .37 This growth may be driven by several factors , some of which include the ability to reconnect with people from the past , find supporting communities to deal with a chronic disease , and connect with younger generations . Currently , 88 % of American adults age 18 and older have a cell phone , 57 % have a laptop , 19 % own an e-book reader , and 19 % have a tablet computer ; about six in ten adults ( 63 % ) go online wirelessly with one of those devices . Gadget ownership is generally correlated with age , education , and household income , although some devices—notably e-book readers and tablets39—are as popular or even more popular with adults ages 30 - 49 than those under 30 .
Some religious groups have become more accepting of homosexuality over time while others remain steady . Ten years ago , a 77 % majority of those unaffiliated with a religion said homosexuality should be accepted by society , and still today fully 80 % say this .
Lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender adults are generally less religious than U.S. society as a whole , a recent Pew Research Center survey found . About half ( 51 % ) declare any religious affiliation at all , versus close to eight-in-ten U.S. adults ; about a fifth ( 17 % ) are both religiously affiliated and say religion is very important in their lives , compared with just over half ( 54 % ) of the general public .
The survey finds that overall public views of the political influence of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) have not changed much in recent years . But they have become more politically and ideologically polarized . Currently , 40 % say the NRA has too much influence over gun control laws in this country , 17 % say it has too little influence , while 36 % say it has the right amount of influence . This balance of opinion is virtually unchanged from May 2013 . In fact , it is also comparable to opinion about the NRA 's influence in 2000 . However , there are wider differences in how conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats see the NRA 's influence . Among Republicans and Republican leaners , just 13 % of conservatives say the NRA has too much influence , down from 32 % in 2000 . By contrast , 68 % of liberal Democrats and Democratic leaners say the organization has too much influence , compared with 57 % who said this in 2000 .
The views of police and the public also differ sharply on whether the country has made the changes needed to give blacks equal rights with whites . A lopsided majority of officers ( 80 % ) say the country has made the necessary changes . But the public is more divided : 48 % say the needed changes have been made while 50 % believe that more changes are needed to assure equal rights for black Americans . Underlying the police views on this question is a substantial difference between black and white police officers – a difference that is , in fact , larger than the gap between the public and police . About nine-in-ten white officers ( 92 % ) but only 29 % of black officers say the needed changes have already been made ( though black officers are about twice as likely as blacks overall to hold this view ) .
The conflict in Iraq has faded in Americans ' minds and in news coverage . Coverage of Iraq comprised just 0.6 % of newshole monitored from Jan. 1 through Dec. 4 in the ongoing News Coverage Index ( NCI ) conducted by the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism . That 's down substantially from 2007 , the first year that PEJ began its ongoing coding of the news . That year , Iraq accounted for 15.4 % of the newshole , spurred by debates in Washington over Iraq policy and the beginning of the surge of U.S. troops in the country . In recent years , Americans have paid closer attention to news about plans for U.S. troops in Iraq than conditions on the ground there . In December 2010 , just 19 % said they were very closely following news about the current situation and events in Iraq .
Now , perhaps as a result of several years of GOP control over both the White House and Congress , blacks have greater reservations : 53 % of blacks now agree that government is `` mostly wasteful and inefficient , '' scarcely fewer than the 57 % of whites who say so .
The number of United Nations peacekeeping forces around the world has peaked in recent months , after falling off in the late 1990s . Today , more than 100,000 uniformed peacekeepers are deployed under 16 different missions – with the highest numbers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Sudan and South Sudan . Peacekeeping activities were relatively infrequent for the next 25 years , but they spiked under the leadership of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , who died in mid-February . During Boutros-Ghali 's January 1992 to December 1996 tenure , the number of ongoing missions rose from 10 to 18 – including high-profile operations in the former Yugoslavia , Somalia and Rwanda – while the number of peacekeeping forces reached a then high of nearly 79,000 in 1994 , according to data from the UN , the Stimson Center and the International Peace Institute .
As was the case earlier in the year , six-in-ten Americans ( 60 % ) now say U.S. troops should be removed from Afghanistan as soon as possible . Just 35 % currently say troops should remain in the country until the situation there has stabilized . By more than three-to-one , Democrats say U.S. troops should be removed as soon as possible ( 73 % ) , rather than remain in Afghanistan until the situation stabilizes ( 22 % ) . A smaller majority of independents supports a quick withdrawal ( 58 % vs. 38 % remain until stable ) . Republicans are evenly divided on this question : 48 % say the troops should be removed as soon as possible , and an identical proportion says they should remain in place . These partisan differences are little changed from the spring .
A decadelong economic recession has contributed to a historic number of people leaving Puerto Rico for the U.S. mainland . Between 2005 and 2015 , Puerto Rico had a net loss of about 446,000 people to the mainland , with job-related ( 40 % ) and family or household reasons ( 39 % ) cited as primary causes among a plurality of those leaving . Puerto Rico 's population losses have affected nearly every county , or municipio , on the island . The population of San Juan , Puerto Rico 's capital and largest metro area , declined by 40,000 people ( -10 % ) between 2005 and 2015 , to 355,000 , by far the largest numeric drop of any municipio .
Millennials remain the most Democratic age cohort : 51 % of Millennials identify as Democrats or lean Democratic , compared with 35 % who identify as Republican or lean Republican . The balance of leaned party identification narrows among Generation X and the Baby Boomers . And among the Silent Generation , Republicans hold a four-point lead in leaned party affiliation ( 47 % -43 % ) . Back to top
In the spring of 2011 , most Japanese seemed confident that despite the destructive force of the March 11th earthquake and tsunami their country would rally as a nation . Indeed , a majority ( 58 % ) predicted the twin disaster would actually make their country stronger . A year later , that sense of resilience has faded . Just 39 % now believe Japan has been strengthened by the earthquake and tsunami , compared with 47 % who say the disasters have weakened the country and 12 % who believe the country has been unaffected .
The number of migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border rose in fiscal 2019 to its highest annual level in 12 years . The 851,508 apprehensions recorded last fiscal year ( October 2018-September 2019 ) were more than double the number the year before ( 396,579 ) but still well short of the levels in the early 2000s , according to CBP , the agency tasked with enforcing immigration laws at the border . The increase in apprehensions has come as a growing number of migrants seek asylum . The demographic profile of those crossing the border has changed , too : People traveling in families , not single adults , accounted for the majority of those apprehended last year ( 56 % ) . And most of those apprehended were from the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras , which have struggled with violence and a lack of economic opportunities . That represents a notable break from the 2000s and early 2010s , when Mexicans accounted for the vast majority of those apprehended .
Looking more broadly at LGBT adults who are in committed relationships ( whether married or not ) , almost all gay men ( 98 % ) and lesbians ( 99 % ) are in relationships with same-sex partners . Only 9 % of bisexuals have same-sex partners ; fully 84 % are involved with someone of the opposite sex .
At this early stage of the presidential race , there are notable demographic differences in the preferences of Democratic voters . Roughly four-in-ten Democrats ( 41 % ) ages 65 and older name Biden as their first choice for the nomination , as do about a third of Democratic voters ages 50 to 64 ( 32 % ) . Biden 's support is much lower among younger Democrats ; among those under age 30 , just 7 % name the former vice president as their first choice . In contrast with Biden , Sanders draws much more support among Democrats under 30 ( 24 % ) than those 65 and older ( 4 % ) . Unlike Biden and Sanders , there are only modest differences across age groups in support for Warren and Harris . Biden is the first choice of 29 % of black Democratic voters , compared with about 10 % each for Sanders and Harris . A relatively large proportion of black Democrats ( 45 % ) express no preference in the open-ended question . Among white Democrats , preferences are more divided , with 26 % naming Biden as their first choice , 20 % naming Warren , and smaller shares supporting Harris ( 12 % ) , Sanders ( 10 % ) and Pete Buttigieg ( 9 % ) .
Looking at other news , 6 % say they followed the World Cup more closely than any other story last week ; 14 % say they followed the international soccer tournament very closely . News about the World Cup made up 2 % of the news coverage last week . Faisal Shazhad 's guilty plea in connection with the May attempt to explode a car bomb in Times Square was the top story for just 1 % of Americans ; 18 % say they followed this story very closely . Interest in the story is far lower than in early May , shortly after the incident , when 37 % said they followed news about the investigation and arrests very closely and 13 % named this the story they followed most closely . The Times Square guilty please took up 2 % of last week 's newshole .
Views on the fairness of the tax system have changed little since April , but a greater share of the public now perceives the system as unfair than said this late in the Obama administration . In February 2015 , about as many described the federal tax system as very or moderately fair ( 50 % ) as said it was not too or not at all fair ( 48 % ) .
On five issues included in the survey , Obama gets a positive net rating on one : race relations . About half ( 48 % ) approve of his handling of race relations , while 43 % disapprove . The public holds mixed views on Obama 's handling of health care policy ( 46 % approve , 50 % disapprove ) , the economy ( 45 % approve , 51 % disapprove ) and global climate change ( 41 % approve , 39 % disapprove ) .
In most of the countries surveyed , relatively few people ( median of 34 % ) have access to a desktop computer , laptop or tablet in their household . The exception is Lebanon , where a majority of adults ( 57 % ) say they have access to such a device . As with most other measures of technological connectedness , those who are younger and more educated are generally more likely to have access to a computer or tablet at home .
A major concern about immigration among people in the countries surveyed is whether immigrants will make the effort to integrate into their new country . In a late 2017 Pew Research Center survey , majorities in all countries agreed that , for the good of their society , immigrants should adopt the country 's customs and traditions .
Many Americans anticipate that various automation technologies will make significant inroads in terms of their development and adoption in the coming decades . Driverless vehicles are perhaps the most prominent example of this trend . Fully 94 % of Americans have some awareness of the effort to develop driverless vehicles , and roughly two-thirds of the public anticipates that most vehicles on the road will be driverless within the next half-century – with 9 % predicting that this will occur in the next 10 years .
While at least 13 % of voting members in Congress are immigrants or children of immigrants , relatively few of these are foreign born : 13 in the House , and just one – Sen. Mazie Hirono , D-Hawaii – in the Senate . These 14 immigrant lawmakers represent just 3 % of all voting members in both chambers , a slight uptick from recent Congresses but substantially below the foreign-born share of Congresses many decades ago . ( For example , about 10 % of members in the first and much smaller Congress of 1789 - 91 were foreign born . About a century later , in the 50th Congress of 1887 - 89 , 8 % of members were born abroad , according to a previous analysis . ) The current share of foreign-born lawmakers in Congress is also far below the foreign-born share of the United States as a whole , which was 13.5 % as of 2016 . Immigrants and children of immigrants represent 24 states , with nearly half representing Western states . California has by far the most : 19 of the state 's 55 members are immigrants or children of immigrants . ( Five members of Illinois ' delegation are immigrants or children of immigrants , the second-highest total of any state . ) Looked at another way , more than a quarter of all members of Congress who are immigrants or children of immigrants represent California .
Irish and Scotch-Irish Americans are most highly concentrated in a few areas of the country , reflecting their historical migration patterns . The poor Irish immigrants who fled their famine-stricken homeland in the 1840s and 1850s generally settled in or close to the Northeastern port cities where they first arrived . New England states continue to have the highest share of residents claiming Irish ancestry : Massachusetts ( 21.6 % ) , New Hampshire ( 21.0 % ) , Rhode Island ( 18.3 % ) , Vermont ( 17.9 % ) and Maine ( 17.6 % ) . The Scotch-Irish , who arrived earlier than the Irish in the early 1700s , moved to the more mountainous interior of what were then Britain 's American colonies . To this day , the states with the highest share of residents claiming Scotch-Irish ancestry are North Carolina ( 2.6 % ) , South Carolina ( 2.4 % ) , Tennessee ( 2.2 % ) and West Virginia ( 2.0 % ) .
The six nations affected by a new executive order that prevents their citizens from obtaining new visas to enter the United States for 90 days accounted for 649,932 legal U.S. entries between fiscal years 2006 and 2015 . This group includes visitors , students and diplomats as well as refugees and new lawful permanent residents , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of government data . The new order , signed by President Donald Trump on March 6 , takes effect March 16 and supersedes a previous order signed on Jan. 27 that was later blocked by U.S. courts . The new order specifies that most citizens from Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen can not enter the U.S. on new visas until security procedures used to evaluate visa applications have been reviewed ; it excludes Iraq , which was a seventh country named in the January order . ( A previous analysis by the Center estimated there were more than 900,000 legal entries of citizens from restricted countries between 2006 and 2015 when Iraq was included in the list of restricted countries . )
When President Obama was elected in 2008 , he reaped 66 % of the vote among Millennials , and in his re-election campaign last year , he came away with 60 % of their vote . Obama is n't going to be running again , but a new survey of young Americans ' attitudes conducted by Harvard University 's Institute of Politics suggests that 18-to-29 year olds now have a more negative view of his presidency . The survey , conducted Oct. 30-Nov. 11 , finds that 54 % of Millennials disapprove of Obama 's performance as president while 41 % approve — an 11-point drop since Harvard 's April survey and the lowest approval rating for Obama among this group since he took office . ( Harvard has conducted its surveys of young Americans 24 times since 2000 ) .
There were 11.2 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. as of 2012 . The total number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. has not changed since 2009 , standing at 11 . 2 million in 2012 . ( A preliminary Pew Research estimate put the 2013 population of unauthorized immigrants at 11.3 million , statistically unchanged from the 2012 figure . ) Before then , the unauthorized immigration population had risen rapidly , from 3.5 million in 1990 to a peak of 12.2 million in 2007 , the year that the Great Recession began . Another major trend has been the decline in the number of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico , falling to 5.9 million in 2012 from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007 .
With nearly 160,000 arrivals so far in 2016 , Italy has received almost the same number of refugees as Greece this year , and by year 's end it may surpass Greece as Europe 's new focal point for refugee flows , according to recent statistics from the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees . Italy only needs to receive about 10,000 more refugees by Dec. 31 to overtake Greece in number of refugee arrivals in 2016 . Already , Italy has received more refugees than it did in all of 2015 ( 153,842 ) and is quickly approaching its 2014 refugee total ( 170,100 ) .
This year , Latinos are expected for the first time to be the nation 's largest racial or ethnic minority in a U.S. presidential election , with a record 32 million projected to be eligible to vote . They will account for 13.3 % of all eligible voters . However , the number of Latino eligible voters is still far below the 60 million Latinos who live in the country . ( Explore our interactive maps and tables to see Latino eligible voters by state and congressional district . )
The patterns in support for Trump also have not changed much . More men ( 44 % ) than women ( 36 % ) approve of Trump 's job performance , though majorities of both men and women disapprove .
While audience data is not available for Spanish-language news radio , revenue data is available and shows relative stability . Average station revenue for Spanish-language news stations that are listed in the BIA Advisory Services database have shown an overall decline of 12 % since 2011 , to about $ 1.2 million .
Majorities of urban and rural residents also say people who do n't live in their type of community have at least a somewhat negative view of those who do ( 63 % in urban and 56 % in rural areas say this ) , while a much smaller share in suburban areas ( 36 % ) say their type of community is seen negatively by those in other areas .
Americans are deeply divided politically on climate change and energy issues . Seventy-one percent of Democrats and independents who lean to the Democratic Party say Earth is getting warmer because of human activity , compared with 27 % of Republicans and independents who lean to the Republican Party . This finding is broadly consistent with other public polls and our previous research on climate change attitudes .
A growing share of Americans now use smartphones as their primary means of online access at home . Today , roughly one-in-five American adults are `` smartphone-only '' internet users – meaning they own a smartphone , but do not have traditional home broadband service .
Additionally , 25 % of smartphone owners ( and 38 % of those ages 18 - 29 ) use their phone at least occasionally to find public transit information . Several groups stand out when it comes to using their phones for public transit information . Minority and immigrant workers tend to rely more heavily on public transportation for commuting to their jobs than other groups do , according to 2009 U.S. Census Bureau data , and these groups are also relatively likely to navigate public transit using a mobile device . Some 37 % of African-American and 30 % of Hispanic smartphone owners use their phone to get public transit information at least occasionally , compared with 21 % of whites . Foreign-born smartphone owners are also more likely to access public transportation on the go than those born in the U.S. ( 34 % vs. 24 % ) . In addition , 41 % of smartphone owners from the Northeast ( home to several of the most traveled transit systems in the country ) use their phone at least occasionally to look up public transit information , a substantially higher share than in other regions of the country . This activity is also more popular among smartphone owners who live in an urban area than among those who live in the suburbs or a rural area .
Seventy years after the end of the Chinese Civil War , about two-thirds of adults in Taiwan identify as just Taiwanese . On the other hand , about three-in-ten ( 28 % ) see themselves as both Taiwanese and Chinese . The question asks respondents whether they consider themselves Taiwanese , Chinese or both . A mere 4 % see themselves as only Chinese . These findings are consistent with other polls showing that people in Taiwan increasingly identify only as Taiwanese as opposed to both Taiwanese and Chinese or solely Chinese . Adults in Taiwan across all age groups are likely to see themselves as Taiwanese . At least six-in-ten in each group claim a Taiwanese identity , while no more than about a third hold a mixed or solely Chinese identity . Still , those ages 18 to 29 are more than 20 percentage points more likely than those 50 and older to see themselves as Taiwanese . They are also less than half as likely than the oldest age group to see themselves as both Taiwanese and Chinese . National identity is additionally split across political affiliation . Those who feel closest to the DPP are most likely to see themselves as Taiwanese . Roughly two-thirds of the politically unaffiliated – those who do not feel close to any party – are also most likely to identify as just Taiwanese , while about three-in-ten consider themselves both Taiwanese and Chinese . Those who identify with the KMT are more likely to say they are both Taiwanese and Chinese than just Taiwanese . Still , about a third of this group identifies as only Taiwanese . No more than about one-in-ten in each political group see themselves as only Chinese .
Most , but not all , retailers rely on the holiday season for a significant chunk of their sales . To get a better sense of how important the holidays are , or are n't , we analyzed more than five years ' worth of quarterly financial data from 20 major retail companies , running the gamut from Wal-Mart and Family Dollar to Coach and Ralph Lauren . Since most retailers ' fiscal years do n't align with the calendar year , we adjusted each company 's data to map the fiscal quarter that included the holidays onto the fourth quarter of each calendar year .
Changes in unemployment during the recession reveal a rapidly worsening situation for foreign-born Hispanics , native-born Hispanics and blacks in the labor market . The unemployment rates for these groups increased by similar amounts from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2008 . However , the number of unemployed persons increased at a much faster rate for foreign-born Hispanics . The U.S. economy employed 2 million fewer persons in the fourth quarter of 2008 than it employed in the fourth quarter of 2007 . Among major racial and ethnic groups , only native-born Hispanics added jobs in the past year . But this was principally a function of demographics . The native-born Latino labor force is increasing more rapidly than the labor force for any other group—4.8 % compared with only 0.7 % growth in the U.S. labor force . Thus , as workers retire or leave employment for other reasons , they are increasingly likely to be replaced by native-born Hispanics .
Republican men are particularly resistant to the idea of boys playing with toys and participating in activities that are typically associated with girls . About six-in-ten Republican men ( 61 % ) say it 's a bad thing for parents to encourage young boys to do this , while just 38 % say this is a good thing . In contrast , a majority of Republican women ( 58 % ) see this as a good approach for raising boys .
A national opinion survey of Mexico by the Pew Research Center , conducted March 4 - 17 among 1,000 adults , finds that roughly two-thirds ( 66 % ) of Mexicans have a favorable opinion of the U.S. – up from 56 % a year ago and dramatically higher than it was following the passage of Arizona 's restrictive immigration law in 2010 , when favorable Mexican attitudes toward the United States slipped to 44 % .
Teen cell phone owners in the 14 - 17 age group are slightly more likely to take photos than those ages 12 - 13 ( 85 % vs. 77 % ) . This older category of teens is also somewhat more likely to send/receive photos than the younger group of teens ( 67 % vs. 56 % ) . However , there is an interesting counter-trend , with more 12 - 13 year-olds sending/receiving video than those 14 and older ( 41 % vs. 27 % ) . Read more in Teens and Mobile Phones ( 2010 ) .
For working people , though , that 's a lot easier to do if you have access to paid sick leave – which 24 % of U.S. civilian workers , or roughly 33.6 million people , do not , according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics . ( `` Civilian workers '' refers to private industry workers and state and local government workers combined . ) The bureau 's 2019 National Compensation Survey ( NCS ) found that , for civilian workers , paid sick leave , while nearly universal at the upper ends of the wage distribution , becomes scarcer the less money one makes . For instance , 92 % of workers in the top quarter of earnings ( meaning hourly wages greater than $ 32.21 ) have access to some form of paid sick leave , versus only 51 % of workers earning wages in the lowest quarter ( $ 13.80 or less ) . Among the lowest-earning tenth – those whose wages are $ 10.80 an hour or less – just 31 % have paid sick leave .
Heightened adoption of mobile devices for news among older adults is due in part to the fact that they had considerably more room to grow than younger adults . Mobile news use , like internet use and mobile ownership in general , was already very high among younger adults , leaving little room for growth compared with older adults . For example , 94 % of both those ages 18 to 29 and 30 to 49 get news on mobile – unchanged since 2016 for 18- to 29-year-olds and only a 9-point rise for the 30 - 49 group . By contrast , among those ages 50 to 64 and those 65 and older , increases of 16 and 24 points respectively in the past year have resulted in majorities in every age group now getting news on mobile . A recent Pew Research Center report similarly found a sharp rise in overall technology adoption among older Americans . Even though a large number of older adults are getting news on mobile devices , that does n't mean they prefer it . Across all adults , a clear majority of those who get news on both mobile devices and desktop/laptop computers prefer to get their news on mobile ( 65 % ) . But those 65 and older are the only age group in which less than half prefer to do so : Only 44 % prefer mobile , compared with about three-quarters of those 18 to 29 ( 77 % ) , figures that have remained steady for both groups over the past year . In the next-highest age group , those 50 to 64 , about half now prefer to get their news on mobile ( 54 % ) , up from about four-in-ten ( 41 % ) a year ago .
Roughly a third of Americans living in urban ( 35 % ) and suburban ( 36 % ) areas say they have ordered from a local restaurant online or through an app because of the outbreak , compared with 21 % of those living in rural areas . In addition , college graduates are more likely than those with some college experience or those who have a high school education or less to say they have ordered food online or through an app from a local restaurant . College graduates ( 28 % ) are more likely than those with some college ( 21 % ) or a high school education or less ( 16 % ) to report that they have ordered groceries online . Similarly , about a quarter ( 26 % ) of Americans ages 30 to 49 say that they have ordered groceries online or through an app from a local store as a result of the coronavirus outbreak , while only 18 % of those 50 and older say the same . ( Adults ages 18 to 29 do not significantly differ from older groups . )
Majority has less trust in what Trump says compared with previous presidents . Overall , 54 % say they trust what Trump says less than they trusted what previous presidents said when they were in office ; just 25 % say they trust Trump more than his predecessors , while 19 % say they trust him about the same amount . About half of Republicans ( 52 % ) say they trust what Trump says more than previous presidents , compared with 5 % of Democrats . Fewer Republicans express more trust in what Trump says than did so in April 2017 ( 66 % ) ; there has been little in change in Democrats ' views .
Education levels among the nation 's immigrants have been steadily rising since the 1960s , just like the native-born population . While there have been gains across the board , the increases have been most dramatic among immigrants from Asia , Europe and the Middle East and less so among those from Mexico and Central America .
Hard times can act to bring families together , and the Great Recession of 2007 - 09 was no different : The number of children living with a grandparent surged after the onset of the recession , as did the number of children whose primary caregiver was that grandparent . A Pew Research Center analysis of Census data found that 7.7 million U.S. children — about 10 % of all children in the country — were living in the same household as at least one of their grandparents in 2011 , and for 3 million that grandparent also was their primary caregiver . Both trends stabilized at higher level after the recession 's official end in mid-2009 .
Overall , the public has mixed views about U.S. efforts to solve world problems : About equal shares say U.S. does too little ( 33 % ) , too much ( 30 % ) and about the right amount ( 29 % ) in helping to solve world problems . Current views mark a shift from April 2016 . Two years ago , a 41 % plurality said the U.S. did too much to solve global problems ; fewer said the country did too little ( 27 % ) or about the right amount ( 28 % ) .
Half of Latinos say their situation in the U.S. has worsened over the past year , up from 32 % in the weeks after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election and the highest level since the Great Recession .1 In addition , more say they have serious concerns about their place in American society now ( 49 % ) than in 2017 ( 41 % ) . And a majority ( 55 % ) say they are worried that they , a family member or close friend could be deported .
In the digital age , new tools and pathways that attract the public 's eye – from YouTube to Twitter – can quickly be noticed by journalists and news organizations as important parts of the news landscape . A new study by Pew Research Center examines one of these emerging tools : crowdfunded journalism , in which projects can be proposed and funded through online appeals to the public . The report examined the 658 journalism projects funded through Kickstarter , one of the largest single platforms for crowdfunding journalism , from April 28 , 2009 ( the day it launched ) through Sept. 15 , 2015 . Though the revenue involved and amount of content produced are nowhere near what comes through the more mainstream media , crowdfunding can help bring to reality work that might otherwise not see the light of day . One striking characteristic of these projects is the wide range of initiatives that have received funding , which we explore here .
Attending a political campaign event or speech is the second most common type of participation among those surveyed – a median of 33 % have done this at least once . Fewer people report participating in volunteer organizations ( a median of 27 % ) , posting comments on political issues online ( 17 % ) , participating in an organized protest ( 14 % ) or donating money to a social or political organization ( 12 % ) .
By roughly two-to-one , both blacks ( 62 % to 29 % ) and Hispanics ( 63 % to 33 % ) are more likely to say free trade agreements have been good for the country than to say they have been bad for the country . By contrast , whites are divided in their views of the impact of free trade agreements ( 47 % say they have been a good thing , 44 % say they have been a bad thing ) .
Federal policy defines `` Hispanic '' not as a race , but as an ethnicity . And it prescribes that Hispanics can in fact be of any race . But these census findings suggest that standard U.S. racial categories might either be confusing or not provide relevant options for Hispanics to describe their racial identity . They also raise an important question long pondered by social scientists and policymakers : Do Hispanics consider their Hispanic background to be part of their racial background , their ethnic background or both ? A new Pew Research Center survey of multiracial Americans finds that , for two-thirds of Hispanics , their Hispanic background is a part of their racial background – not something separate . This suggests that Hispanics have a unique view of race that does n't necessarily fit within the official U.S. definitions .
Internet penetration rates – as measured by internet use or smartphone ownership – remain high in North America and much of Europe , as well as in parts of the Asia-Pacific . Among the countries surveyed , South Korea stands out as the most heavily connected society , with 96 % of adults reporting internet use . Yet , others are not far behind . In Australia , the Netherlands , Sweden , Canada , the U.S. , Israel , the United Kingdom , Germany , France and Spain , roughly nine-in-ten report internet use . The global digital divide is largely an economic story . Richer countries , as measured by gross domestic product per capita ( purchasing power parity ) , tend to have higher rates of internet use , while poorer countries tend to have lower rates . This pattern has been consistent across prior surveys and remains today for both internet use and smartphone ownership . The pattern of smartphone ownership is similar to internet use , with people in wealthier countries exhibiting higher rates of ownership . But the gap in smartphone ownership is narrower than in the past , as many move directly from not owning a phone at all to owning a mobile device . Landline phones are simply being skipped by large numbers of people in emerging and developing markets .
The opinions of police and the public also differ on some important issues facing the country . While a majority of the police and public support some gun control measures , roughly one-third of police ( 32 % ) but 64 % of the public favor banning assault-style weapons . And while 67 % of officers say the deaths of blacks in recent encounters with police are isolated incidents , less than half of the public ( 39 % ) shares this view .
In recent years , the debate over illegal immigration has often been posed as a choice between two competing priorities—increasing border security and enforcement or providing a path to citizenship to immigrants who are in the country illegally . Latinos are nearly twice as likely as the general public ( 42 % versus 24 % ) to say the priority should be a path to citizenship for immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally . About as many Latinos as the general public ( 46 % versus 43 % ) say equal priority should be given to enforcement and legalization . Just 10 % of Latinos say priority should be given to better border security and enforcement , compared with 29 % of the general public .
Latinos make up 15 percent of the total U.S. population , and in many respects their downbeat assessment of the nation 's economy is similar to that of the general population . According to a recent survey from the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press ( December 2008 ) , almost six-in-ten ( 59 % ) say the U.S. economy is in poor condition , a belief held by 63 % of Latinos . And similar shares of the general U.S. population and Latinos say that jobs are difficult to find where they live—73 % versus 78 % . However , Latinos hold a more negative view of their own current personal financial situation than does the population as a whole . More than three-in-four ( 75 % ) Latinos , and 84 % of foreign-born Latinos , say their current personal finances are in either fair or poor shape , while 61 % of the general U.S. population says that . But Latinos are more optimistic than others about the future : 67 % expect that their financial circumstances will improve over the next year ; just 56 % of the general population feels the same way .
Nearly two-in-ten each ( 18 % ) say they very closely followed news about Obama releasing his long-form birth certificate or news about continuing unrest in the Middle East . About one-in-ten say the birth certificate news ( 8 % ) or Middle East developments ( 8 % ) was their top story of the week . News out of the Middle East accounted for 6 % coverage , most focusing on the situation in Syria , according to PEJ .
The biggest change in partisan affiliation in recent years is the growing share of Americans who decline to affiliate with either party : 39 % call themselves independents , 32 % identify as Democrats and 23 % as Republicans , based on aggregated data from 2014 . The balance of leaned partisan affiliation has changed little in recent years : 48 % identify with the Democratic Party or lean Democratic , while 39 % identify as Republicans or lean toward the GOP . Democrats have led in leaned party identification among the public for most of the past two decades .
The European countries included in the survey hold differing views on how immigrants impact society and the economy . A median of 53 % say that migrants make their country stronger through their hard work and talents , while 41 % believe they take jobs and social benefits . Swedes and Brits are the most positive : Roughly six-in-ten think immigrant talent benefits their country , and half or more in Germany , Spain , France and the Netherlands say the same . But just 5 % in Hungary express this view . Opinions on this issue have shifted with time in some countries . Since 2014 , more people in France ( increase of 11 percentage points ) , the UK ( +10 ) and Spain ( +9 ) share the view that immigrants strengthen their country .
Perhaps the most telling partisan divisions are on how easy voting should be in the United States . Overall , two-thirds of the public ( 67 % ) says `` everything possible should be done to make it easy for every citizen to vote , '' while only about a third ( 32 % ) say citizens `` should have to prove they want to vote '' by registering in advance .
Just 17 % of Americans say that `` many of the country 's problems could be dealt with more effectively if U.S. presidents did n't have to worry so much about Congress or the courts , '' while 77 % take the view that `` it would be too risky to give U.S. presidents more power to deal directly with many of the country 's problems '' – including sizable majorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents ( 87 % ) and Republicans and Republican leaners ( 65 % ) .
The competition for media exposure between Barack Obama and John McCain was much closer last week than in the past several months of the presidential campaign . During much of the primary campaign and in the weeks since the general election kicked-off in early June , Barack Obama has consistently received more media attention than his Republican rival , John McCain . By contrast last week , according to the Project for Excellence in Journalism 's Campaign Coverage Index , Obama was featured prominently in 73 % of all campaign news stories while McCain was featured in 62 % of all stories .
While less common than keeping in touch with the people in their lives , around half of online sub-Saharan Africans use the internet to get news and information about politics ( median of 53 % of internet users ) or public or government services ( 51 % ) . Another four-in-ten use it to access information about health and medicine ( 41 % ) .
The number of refugees entering the United States each month has declined sharply so far in fiscal 2017 , falling from 9,945 in October 2016 to 3,316 in April 2017 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. State Department data . All but four states reported declines in monthly arrivals . Nationwide , the number of refugee arrivals decreased in each of the first five months of the fiscal year , the longest consecutive monthly decline on record ( monthly data before 2000 are not available ) . In April , however , the number of arriving refugees rose to 3,316 , compared with 2,070 in March .
In many cases , the political divides over these issues are wider than the racial or ethnic differences . And as with many other issues , the debate over affirmative action is becoming more polarized along partisan lines , largely due to increased support for such programs by Democrats . When Pew Research first began asking the '' preferential treatment '' question back in 1987 , only 33 % of Democrats supported the principle ; by 2012 that figure had risen to 52 % . Meanwhile , Republicans have remained solid in their disapproval : Just 12 % agree that we should make every possible effort , including preferential treatment , to improve the position of blacks and other minorities – virtually unchanged from 15 % a quarter-century ago .
Given the historical context of relatively low voter turnout among young adults , Millennials seemed ascendant in the 2008 election when 50 % of eligible Millennials voted . By comparison , 61 % of the Generation X electorate reported voting that year , as did even higher percentages of Boomer and Silent Generation eligible voters . In 2008 Millennials comprised 18 % of the electorate , but as a result of their relatively low turnout ( compared with older generations ) they made up only 14 % of Americans who said they voted .
About six-in-ten Germans ( 62 % ) believe the United States is a reliable ally . But only 13 % see Washington as very reliable . German men ( 68 % ) are more likely than women ( 56 % ) to see the U.S. as a dependable strategic partner . Notably , 31 % of Germans think the U.S. is not a reliable ally .
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , conducted June 7 - 17 among 2,013 adults , including 1,563 registered voters , finds that the contest between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney is shaping up to be a close one . Not only is the horserace nearly even – 50 % of registered voters currently support Obama or lean toward him , while 46 % support or lean toward Romney – but each party holds distinctly different advantages . Voter preferences are more closely divided between Obama and Romney than they were in May , when Obama led Romney by seven points ( 49 % to 42 % ) . Currently , 50 % favor Obama while 46 % back Romney . Yet it is notable that in eight general election matchups since last October , Romney has never led Obama .
Brazilians offer favorable opinions of the U.S. and China , their country 's two biggest trading partners , although America 's image is somewhat more positive . About six-in-ten ( 62 % ) give the U.S. a favorable rating ; 29 % have an unfavorable opinion . Looking at the other Latin American nations in the survey , 56 % of Mexicans offer a favorable opinion , while 35 % have a negative view of their neighbor to the north . And in Argentina , about the same number rate the U.S. favorably ( 42 % ) as rate it unfavorably ( 41 % ) .
Economies worldwide are still struggling to recover from the 2008 global financial crisis , and growth overall has been lackluster , especially in Europe . But life is improving in some places more than others . People in emerging markets now rival those in advanced economies in their self-reported well-being : A median of 51 % in emerging markets now say they are satisfied with their lives , an increase of 18 points since 2007 .
Just 9 % say they followed news about the economy – the second ranking story on the list – more closely than any other news . About a third ( 35 % ) say they followed news about the economy very closely . This topic garnered 6 % of coverage .
Fathers today get higher grades than mothers for their performance , especially from women . Overall , 47 % of Americans say fathers of children under the age of 18 are now doing a worse job as parents than fathers did 20 or 30 years ago ; this compares with 56 % who say mothers are doing a worse job . About one-in-five ( 21 % ) say today 's fathers are doing a better job compared with fathers a generation ago ; far fewer ( 9 % ) say that today 's mothers are doing a better job than their predecessors 20 or 30 years ago .
The share of female CEOs of Fortune 500 companies reached an all-time high of 6.4 % in 2017 , with 32 women heading major firms . But the share fell to 4.8 % in 2018 after several high-profile women left their posts , including Denise Morrison of Campbell Soup Co. and Meg Whitman of Hewlett Packard Enterprise . The late Katherine Graham , of The Washington Post Co. , was the first female CEO to make the Fortune 500 list , in 1972 . As recently as 1995 , there were no female CEOs on the Fortune 500 list .
For more than a decade , overwhelming majorities of Americans have said that it is more important for the president to focus on domestic policy than foreign policy . Today , about seven-in-ten say it is more important for President Donald Trump to focus on domestic policy right now ( 69 % ) , little different than the share saying this shortly before he took office or the shares who wanted Barack Obama to focus on domestic policy in the years prior .
Survey respondents were read a list of positive and negative characteristics , and for each one , were asked whether it describes Donald Trump . Around the globe , people associate a number of negative characteristics with the U.S. leader . Most say he is arrogant , intolerant and dangerous , while few think of him as well-qualified or as someone who cares about ordinary people . Describing Trump as charismatic is more common , although global publics on balance do not think of him as charismatic either . They do , however , see Trump as a strong leader – a median of 55 % across the nations polled describe him this way .
In large part , the steep downturn over the past year reflects a crumbling of the GOP unity over progress in Iraq . As recently as a year ago , more than three-quarters of Republicans ( 77 % ) believed things were going at least fairly well in Iraq – a position most Democrats and independents then rejected . But today , a bare 51 % majority of Republicans say the situation in Iraq is going well , down 26 points from a year ago .
While public attitudes toward individual leaders are mixed , Europeans express the most confidence in Germany 's Angela Merkel . Across 14 EU countries , a median of 57 % express confidence in Merkel 's ability to do the right thing regarding world affairs . Views of French President Emmanuel Macron are more mixed , while Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban get generally negative reviews from people on the continent .
About half of post-9/11 veterans say readjusting to civilian life was difficult . While about three-quarters of all veterans ( 73 % ) say readjusting to civilian life was very or somewhat easy , roughly one-in-four ( 26 % ) say it was at least somewhat difficult . There is a significant gap between pre- and post-9/11 veterans in this regard . About half of post-9/11 veterans ( 47 % ) say it was very or somewhat difficult for them to readjust to civilian life after their military service . By comparison , only about one-in-five veterans whose service ended before 9/11 ( 21 % ) say their transition was very or somewhat difficult . A large majority of pre-9/11 veterans ( 78 % ) say it was easy for them to make the transition .
About one-in-ten ( 8 % ) very closely followed reports about the Russian elections and protests about their validity ; 1 % says this was the news they followed most closely . News about the elections made up 1 % of coverage .
Among Americans , 36 % choose the United Kingdom as the most or second-most important foreign policy partner . Roughly two-in-ten say China ( 23 % ) and Canada ( 20 % ) are top partners , but Germany is chosen by only 13 % as the most or second-most important partner , in between Israel at 15 % and Mexico at 12 % .
A large majority of Filipinos ( 86 % ) hold a favorable opinion of Duterte , with 41 % holding a very favorable opinion of the president . Only 12 % of Filipinos have an unfavorable view of Duterte .
President Donald Trump is generally seen more negatively than other major world leaders , with a median of 83 % expressing no confidence in him on world affairs .
Similar shares of adults younger than 30 express positive views of capitalism ( 52 % ) and socialism ( 50 % ) . Among older age groups , views of capitalism are more positive than opinions of socialism . Women are more likely than men to view socialism positively ( 46 % vs. 38 % ) , while a much larger share of men ( 74 % ) than women ( 56 % ) view capitalism positively . Nearly twice as many men as women have a very positive impression of capitalism ( 33 % vs. 17 % ) .
The Mexican government has deported a record number of Central American children traveling without a guardian since last fall , which President Obama and other U.S. officials say has contributed to a significant drop in children apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border . Mexico 's 3,819 deportations of unaccompanied minors from Central America during the first five months of the fiscal year represent a 56 % increase over the same period a year earlier , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Mexican and U.S. government data . The stepped up security was a result of a plan by Mexican officials to address the record surge in child migrants last year . Overall , U.S. officials apprehended 12,509 unaccompanied children at the U.S.-Mexico border in the first five months of the fiscal year that began in October , down from 21,403 over the same time period a year ago . ( Most children apprehended during this fiscal year — 7,771 — came from the Central American countries of El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras , with nearly all of the rest coming from Mexico . )
Among people who offer an opinion of the religiosity of leading Democrats , more say that John Edwards ( 28 % ) and Barack Obama ( 24 % ) are very religious than say the same about Hillary Clinton ( 16 % ) . Yet wide majorities see all three as at least somewhat religious , and those who do view the candidates in overwhelmingly favorable terms .
The type of attack carried out against Malala – along with other social hostilities involving religion – is captured in Pew Research Center 's annual coding of global religious restrictions . The Social Hostilities Index ( SHI ) is a 10-point index that measures acts of religious hostility by private individuals , organizations or groups in society , with a score of 10 indicating the highest level of hostilities .
Today , social networking site use is a major activity for internet users from a wide range of demographic groups . Younger adults are especially avid adopters , but social networking continues to grow in popularity for older adults as well . Six out of ten internet users ages 50 - 64 are social networking site users , as are 43 % of those ages 65 and older .
Nearly two-thirds ( 409,449 ) of the total legal U.S. entries from Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen between fiscal 2006 and 2015 were admitted using temporary non-immigrant visas . Those on temporary visas were mostly visitors to the U.S. , but could also include students , businesspeople , short-term workers and diplomats , according to an analysis of Department of Homeland Security data . Over the period in question , the number of temporary visa entries from the six countries nearly tripled : from about 22,000 in 2006 to nearly 65,000 in 2015 . ( Temporary immigrants represent events and not unique individuals ; individuals may have entered the U.S. multiple times during a fiscal year . ) Over the same period , annual refugee admissions from these six countries fluctuated , but about the same number entered in fiscal 2006 ( 15,035 ) as in 2015 ( 15,243 ) , according to U.S. State Department data . The annual total jumped for these six countries , to 26,842 in fiscal 2016 , a year when 12,587 refugees were admitted from Syria alone . In all , 110,003 refugees from these six countries were admitted between fiscal years 2006 and 2015 , representing nearly two-in-ten ( 18 % ) of all refugee admissions during the period . The annual number of new lawful permanent residents entering from Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen also increased between fiscal years 2006 and 2015 , from 11,392 to 14,397 arrivals . This is a group that can include family members of U.S. citizens and awardees of the diversity immigrant visa program . In all , 130,480 people entered the U.S. between 2006 and 2015 as new lawful permanent residents from these six nations , with nearly half ( 53 % ) from Iran .
The new survey finds wide awareness about the census across all demographic groups . A majority of U.S. adults ( 54 % ) say they have heard something recently – within the last month or so – about the census . Adults younger than 30 are least likely to have heard something recently , while those ages 65 and older are more than twice as likely to say the same . Men are more likely than women to say so , as are whites when compared with black and Hispanic adults .
In 2010 , households in the U.S. were more economically divided than households in the Western European countries examined in this report . The U.S. is the only country in which fewer than six-in-ten adults were in the middle class . Meanwhile , compared with those in many Western European countries , greater shares of Americans were either lower income ( 26 % ) or upper income ( 15 % ) . The middle class is a significant presence in the Western European countries analyzed , even as it is shrinking in many countries . Middle-class shares ranged from 64 % in Spain to 80 % in Denmark and Norway in 2010 . The share of adults who were lower income was lowest in the Netherlands ( 13 % ) and highest in Spain ( 24 % ) , and upper-income shares ranged from 6 % in Norway to 14 % in the UK .
While concern over the budget deficit has gone up , the percentage giving priority to dealing with the nation 's energy problem has declined significantly – and this decline has taken place among Republicans , Democrats and independents alike . In the current survey , 49 % rate energy a top priority , down 11 points from 60 % in 2009 . In the late 2000s , about six-in-ten consistently gave top priority to dealing with the nation 's energy problem . The current number is more in line with views from the early years of that decade , when the percentage that said dealing with the nation 's energy problem should be a top priority ranged from the low-to-mid 40s .
In general , the public continues to say that good diplomacy , rather than military strength , is the best way to ensure peace . Nearly six-in-ten ( 58 % ) say good diplomacy is the best way to ensure peace ; 30 % say the best way to ensure peace is through military strength . These views have changed only modestly since the question was first asked two decades ago . Younger people are far more likely than older Americans to view good diplomacy as the best path to peace . Majorities of those under 30 ( 75 % ) and 30 - 49 ( 62 % ) say this , compared with about half of those 50 - 64 ( 50 % ) and 65 and older ( 47 % ) .
Twitter 's user base has grown rapidly but may be plateauing . Twitter averaged 320 million monthly active users ( MAUs ) in the fourth quarter of 2015 , 9.6 % more than in the same quarter a year earlier , according to the company 's financial disclosure statements . That 's Twitter 's slowest annualized growth rate since at least 2011 , when comparable data began to be publicly disclosed . Domestic , international and total MAUs were all flat or slightly down compared with the third quarter . ( The company defines an MAU as anyone who accessed the service at least once in the past 30 days . ) Twitter is largely a global service . Twitter has nearly four times as many users internationally as in the United States – 254 million versus 65 million , as of the fourth quarter of 2015 , according to company filings . However , the company says , Twitter 's penetration generally is higher in the U.S. than in other countries in which it operates . Last year , Pew Research Center estimated that 23 % of all adult internet users , and a fifth of the entire adult population , uses Twitter . In the U.S. , usage is highest among urban residents , adults under 50 and people in upper-income brackets .
In fiscal 2017 , 748,746 people received family-based U.S. lawful permanent residence . The program allows someone to receive a green card if they already have a spouse , child , sibling or parent living in the country with U.S. citizenship or , in some cases , a green card . Immigrants from countries with large numbers of applicants often wait for years to receive a green card because a single country can account for no more than 7 % of all green cards issued annually . President Donald Trump said his legislation , when proposed , would prioritize family-based green cards to immediate family members . Today , family-based immigration – referred to by some as `` chain migration '' – is the most common way people gain green cards , in recent years accounting for about two-thirds of the more than 1 million people who receive them annually . This share could decline to about one-third under the president 's proposal . In fiscal 2017 , 137,855 employment-based green cards were awarded to foreign workers and their families . The Trump administration 's points-based plan would increase the number of green cards granted due to having certain skills . The new system would eliminate a green card for immigrant investors who put money into commercial U.S. enterprises that are intended to create jobs or benefit the economy . This path to a green card , the EB-5 program , has drawn criticism from some lawmakers .
Despite their negative views about the press and the accuracy and fairness of its reports , most people say they are able to find news that is accurate . About six-in-ten ( 62 % ) say the news sources they use most generally get the facts straight ; by comparison , just 25 % say that news organizations generally get the facts straight . While the vast majority of people say the press , as a whole , tends to favor one side ( 77 % ) , the public is divided over whether the sources they rely on most deal fairly with all sides or not . About half ( 49 % ) say the news sources they use most tend to favor one side , but about as many ( 45 % ) say their choice sources treat all sides fairly .
Analyzing the data in this way reveals that Americans are the most supportive of free speech and a free press . Several European and Latin American nations also emerge as relatively strong supporters , as do Canada , Australia and South Africa . Meanwhile , Senegal , Jordan , Pakistan , Ukraine , Burkina Faso and Vietnam are at the bottom of the index , indicating relatively low levels of support for free expression . In many nations the internet has created an important new public space where debates about political and social issues thrive . Even though internet freedom ranks last among the six broad democratic rights included on the survey , majorities in 32 of 38 countries nonetheless say it is important to live in a country where people can use the internet without government censorship . Across the 38 nations , a median of 50 % believe it is very important to live in a country with an uncensored internet . Intense support for internet freedom is highest in Argentina , the U.S. , Germany and Spain – roughly seven-in-ten in these four nations consider it very important . It is lowest in Burkina Faso and Indonesia ( 21 % very important in both countries ) . Internet freedom tends to be especially important to younger people , as well as to those who say they use the internet at least occasionally or own a smartphone . There is a strong correlation between the percentage of people in a country who use the internet and the percentage who say a free internet is very important , suggesting that as access to the Web continues to spread around the globe in the coming years , the desire for freedom in cyberspace may grow as well .
There also are striking educational differences in partisans ' views of global warming . Among Republicans , higher education is linked to greater skepticism about global warming — fully 43 % of Republicans with a college degree say that there is no evidence of global warming , compared with 24 % of Republicans with less education . But among Democrats , the pattern is the reverse . Fully 75 % of Democrats with college degrees say that there is solid evidence of global warming and that it is caused by human activities . This is far higher than among Democrats with less education among whom 52 % say the same . Independents , regardless of education levels , fall in between these partisan extremes .
It 's summertime , which means Americans are embarking on vacation trips to destinations near and far . One getaway in the `` far '' category would be a trip to space , something a host of private companies are trying to make possible . But it 's not an excursion that appeals to everyone – more U.S. adults say they would not want to orbit the Earth than say they would , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . About four-in-ten Americans ( 42 % ) say they would definitely or probably be interested in orbiting the Earth in a spacecraft in the future , while roughly six-in-ten ( 58 % ) say they would not be interested . Among the 42 % of Americans who said they would be interested in traveling into space , the most common reason given ( by 45 % of those asked ) was to `` experience something unique . '' Smaller shares of this group said they would want to be able to view the Earth from space ( 29 % ) or `` learn more about the world '' ( 20 % ) . Among the 58 % who said they would not want to orbit the Earth aboard a spacecraft , equal shares said the main reason was that such a trip would be either `` too expensive '' ( 28 % of those asked ) or `` too scary '' ( 28 % ) or that their age or health would n't allow it ( 28 % ) .
Most Americans also have at least a fair amount of confidence in medical scientists and scientists to act in the best interest of the public . Some 84 % of U.S. adults express confidence in medical scientists ; 24 % say they have a great deal of confidence and six-in-ten ( 60 % ) have a fair amount of confidence in medical scientists to act in the public 's best interests . Three-quarters of Americans ( 76 % ) have either a great deal ( 21 % ) or a fair amount of confidence ( 55 % ) in scientists , generally , to act in the public interest . Confidence in either group is about the same or only modestly different across party and ideological groups .
How big will the U.S. be ? The U.S. population is projected to grow by 89 million residents from 2010 to 2050 . The U.S. is likely to grow faster than European and East Asian countries , but slower than Nigeria , which is expected to replace the U.S. as the world 's third most populous country .
Among those who are religiously unaffiliated , meanwhile , the vast majority ( 84 % ) say casual sex is sometimes or always acceptable , including roughly nine-in-ten atheists ( 94 % ) and agnostics ( 95 % ) who say this . The religiously unaffiliated , also known as `` nones , '' are those who describe themselves , religiously , as atheist , agnostic or as `` nothing in particular . ''
Men and women who have used online dating sites and apps hold somewhat differing views about how widespread online harassment is on these platforms , according to the most recent survey . For example , while 32 % of female users say people being harassed or bullied is a very common occurrence on online dating platforms , that share falls to 19 % among male users . These gender differences persist across all age ranges . Similarly , women who have used online dating platforms are more likely than men to say it is very common for people to receive sexually explicit messages or images they did n't ask for ( 55 % vs. 42 % ) . This gender gap is more pronounced among online daters under the age of 50 than among those 50 and older .
Death penalty supporters overwhelmingly view it as morally justified : 90 % say that when someone commits a crime like murder , the death penalty is morally justified . Just 26 % of death penalty opponents view it as morally justified . Yet the differences between death penalty supporters and opponents are not as stark when it comes to other opinions about capital punishment . A large majority ( 84 % ) of those who oppose the death penalty say there is a risk that an innocent person will be put to death ; so too do 63 % of death penalty supporters .
`` We find substantial under-reporting of LGBT [ lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ] identity and behaviors as well as underreporting of anti-gay sentiment …even under anonymous and very private conditions , '' the researchers wrote in a working paper just published by the National Bureau of Economic Research . In the results using the experimental technique , self-reports of non-heterosexual identity amounted to 19 % of those surveyed using the Veiled Report methods – 65 % higher than the 11 % in the control group . The share reporting same-sex sexual experiences also grew from 17 % in the control group to 27 % in the Veiled Report group , they reported . ( Because their experiment did not use a random sample of the adult population , the researchers do not attempt to estimate the actual size of the country 's gay and lesbian population . ) The experimental method also increased the rates of anti-gay sentiment . For example , the share who disapproved of having an openly gay manager at work increased from 16 % in the control group to 27 % in the Veiled Report group . The proportion who thought it should be legal to discriminate when hiring on the basis of sexual orientation also rose from 14 % to 25 % . However , those in the Veiled Report treatment were less likely than those in the Direct Report treatment to say that a homosexual person `` can change their sexual orientation if they choose to do so '' ( 22 % vs. 15 % ) . As the authors suggest , `` This indicates that participants saw it more socially desirable to report that sexual orientation is changeable , which goes in the opposite direction of a general ‘ pro-LGBT ' norm . ''
Striking seasonal fluctuations are apparent in the apprehension data ( Figure 11 ) . The highest numbers of apprehensions are recorded from February to May as migrants move north for the construction and harvesting seasons . Meanwhile the lowest numbers of apprehensions are registered in November and December when many unauthorized migrants travel south for the holidays . That seasonal pattern has remained consistent for many years , regardless of whether the total number of apprehensions for the entire year is up or down . Looking back to the start of the decade , for example , the highest number of apprehensions has occurred in March of every year . From 2004 to 2006 , monthly apprehensions during the peak months leveled off at about 150,000 . The latest data , for March 2007 , shows the number of apprehensions declined to about 114,000 . That represents a 30 % decrease from March 2006 , when apprehensions exceeded 160,000 .
In 2016 , 186,874 Iowans participated in the Republican caucus and 171,109 participated in the Democratic caucus , both held on Feb. 1 . On that date , according to the Iowa secretary of state 's office , there were 586,835 active registered Democratic voters and 615,763 active Republican registered voters . That works out to 30.3 % of eligible Republicans and 29.2 % of eligible Democrats participating in the caucuses , or 18.5 % of the state 's total 1,937,317 active registered voters . ( By comparison , in 2016 , turnout averaged 29.3 % across all the Democratic and Republican primaries . )
However , the applications used to upload , share and now tag photos have changed dramatically over the past year . Data gathered by Hitwise demonstrate the radical growth of a decidedly Web 2.0 socially-integrated photo service such as Photobucket diverging from the stagnant market share of a `` traditional '' online photo site like Kodakgallery .
Though ratings have improved in recent months , CNN 's morning programming ranked third in viewership in 2012 , averaging just 239,000 viewers per day , compared with 452,000 for MSNBC 's Morning Joe and 1.13 million for Fox 's Fox and Friends , according to Nielsen Media Research . Other parts of the day look no better . Continued declines in prime-time viewership , considered the most critical time for cable news , placed the channel third behind Fox and MSNBC for three years straight . In 2012 , it fell to third place in daytime viewership for the first time . There 's more to the story , of course . CNN remains a highly profitable organization , with a wide digital reach and a sizable international presence ; it operates more bureaus around the world than Fox and MSNBC combined . And in May , the channel 's previous morning show , Starting Point , averaged 380,000 viewers , according to Nielsen—not enough to come close to Fox and Friends ' 1.26 million , but enough to approach MSNBC 's Morning Joe , which drew an average of 387,000 .
In the group 's 2018 General Social Survey , the most recent available , 44 % of Americans overall have a great deal of confidence in the scientific community , while 47 % have only some confidence and 7 % have hardly any . This was roughly the same share as in 2016 , when 40 % said they had a great deal of confidence in scientific leaders . ( The 4-percentage-point uptick does not reach statistical significance . ) Public confidence in the scientific community stands out as among the most stable of about a dozen institutions rated in the GSS since the mid-1970s . Confidence in medicine has been somewhat less stable , however . It declined in the early 1990s and has ticked downward again in more recent years , from 41 % in 2010 to 36 % in 2016 and 37 % in NORC 's most recent survey . Public confidence in the science community and in medicine is higher than in many other institutions . Confidence is highest for leaders of the military , with 60 % expressing a great deal of confidence . At the opposite end of the spectrum , just 13 % of Americans express a great deal of confidence in the press and 6 % say the same about Congress . On average , confidence in institutions is lower today than it was in the mid-1970s .
Religious differences also extend to questions about societal acceptance of transgender people . Most white evangelical Protestants ( 61 % ) say society has `` gone too far '' when it comes to accepting people who are transgender . And Pew Research Center polling conducted in the summer of 2016 found that seven-in-ten white evangelical Protestants think that transgender people should be required to use the public restrooms that correspond with their birth gender . By comparison , other Christian groups are more evenly divided on these questions . And most religious `` nones '' ( 57 % ) say society has `` not gone far enough '' when it comes to accepting people who are transgender , and that transgender individuals should be allowed to use public restrooms corresponding to their current gender identity ( 70 % ) .
The sharp downward trend in net migration from Mexico began about five years ago and has led to the first significant decrease in at least two decades in the unauthorized Mexican population . As of 2011 , some 6.1 million unauthorized Mexican immigrants were living in the U.S. , down from a peak of nearly 7 million in 2007 , according to Pew Hispanic Center estimates based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau . Over the same period , the population of authorized immigrants from Mexico rose modestly , from 5.6 million in 2007 to 5.8 million in 2011 . The net standstill in Mexican-U.S. migration flows is the result of two opposite trend lines that have converged in recent years . During the five-year period from 2005 to 2010 , a total of 1.4 million Mexicans immigrated to the United States , down by more than half from the 3 million who had done so in the five-year period of 1995 to 2000 . Meantime , the number of Mexicans and their children who moved from the U.S. to Mexico between 2005 and 2010 rose to 1.4 million , roughly double the number who had done so in the five-year period a decade before . While it is not possible to say so with certainty , the trend lines within this latest five-year period suggest that return flow to Mexico probably exceeded the inflow from Mexico during the past year or two .
Foreign trade also has been a contentious issue throughout the 2016 campaign . Currently , 45 % of voters say free trade agreements have been a good thing for the United States , while about as many ( 47 % ) say they have been a bad thing . Clinton supporters , by a wide margin ( 59 % to 32 % ) , view free trade agreements positively . An even larger majority of Trump supporters ( 68 % ) view them negatively . The pattern is similar in opinions about the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement ( TPP ) , though larger shares of voters do not offer an opinion about the TPP .
More Latino children are living in poverty—6.1 million in 2010—than children of any other racial or ethnic group . This marks the first time in U.S. history that the single largest group of poor children is not white . In 2010 , 37.3 % of poor children were Latino , 30.5 % were white and 26.6 % were black , according to an analysis of new data from the U.S. Census Bureau by the Pew Hispanic Center , a project of the Pew Research Center . Of the 6.1 million Latino children living in poverty , more than two-thirds ( 4.1 million ) are the children of immigrant parents , according the new Pew Hispanic Center analysis . The other 2 million are the children of parents born in the U.S . Among the 4.1 million impoverished Latino children of immigrants , the vast majority ( 86.2 % ) were born in the U.S .
Throughout most of the year , Democrats have followed the presidential campaign more closely than Republicans . However , last week marked the largest partisan gap in campaign interest since the start of the presidential race in early 2007 . Democrats were almost twice as likely as Republicans to say they followed the campaign very closely ( 52 % vs. 28 % ) .
Perceptions about the relationship between Islam and violence also have not changed significantly since last year – though these opinions , already politically polarized , have become even more so . Currently , 46 % say the Islamic religion is more likely than others to encourage violence among its believers ; about as many ( 45 % ) say the Islamic religion does not encourage violence more than other religions .
Dads are much more involved in child care than they were 50 years ago . In 2016 , fathers reported spending an average of eight hours a week on child care – about triple the time they provided in 1965 . And fathers put in about 10 hours a week on household chores in 2016 , up from four hours in 1965 . By comparison , mothers spent an average of about 14 hours a week on child care and 18 hours a week on housework in 2016 .
One demographic measure where the three metro areas are similar is the marital status of their Catholic populations . Nearly or roughly half of Catholic adults in New York ( 50 % ) , Philadelphia ( 45 % ) and Washington , D.C. , ( 45 % ) are married , similar to U.S. Catholics overall ( 52 % ) . About one-in-ten Catholics in each area ( and in the country as a whole ) report that they are currently living with a romantic partner outside of marriage .
Seven-in-ten ( 72 % ) Latinos ages 16 and older say they have visited a public library or bookmobile in person at one point or another in their lives , the survey shows , a share below that of whites ( 83 % ) and blacks ( 80 % ) . But this finding masks a large difference among Latinos . Fully 83 % of U.S.-born Latinos say they have visited a public library at some point in their lives—a share similar to that of whites and blacks . However , among immigrant Latinos , a smaller share—60 % —say they have visited a public library or bookmobile in person . Some public library services can also be accessed remotely through library websites . Here , too , though , the survey finds a gap in use between U.S.-born Latinos ( 49 % ) , blacks ( 48 % ) and whites ( 45 % ) who say they have accessed a public library website and immigrant Latinos ( 27 % ) who say the same .
There are sizable educational differences in early midterm vote preferences : Those with a postgraduate degree favor the Democratic candidate over the Republican by roughly two-to-one ( 62 % to 30 % ) and those with a four-year college degree favor the Democrat , 53 % to 40 % . Preferences are more divided among voters who do not have a college degree .
College enrollment among low-income students has generally increased over the past several decades , according to data from the 2013 Digest of Educational Statistics ( an arm of the federal Education Department ) . But the Great Recession and weak recovery have eroded the gains of recent years , and middle- and upper-income students remain far more likely to go to college . In 2012 , the most recent year for which NCES figures are available , 50.9 % of recent low-income high school completers ( a category that includes both graduates and people who completed an equivalency degree and who are ages 16 to 24 ) were enrolled in a 2- or 4-year college . That 's down from the record-high 58.4 % in 2007 , and just half a percentage point higher than the rate in 1993 . But enrollment rates among middle- and high-income students also have risen , to 64.7 % and 80.7 % , respectively , in 2012 . ( NCES defines `` low income '' as the bottom 20 % of all family incomes , `` high income '' as the top 20 % , and `` middle income '' as the 60 % in between . ) Looking at it another way , low-income students now are enrolled at about the same rate as middle-income students were in the mid-1980s .
As the U.S. presidential election approaches , very few polled in Canada , Europe or the Asia-Pacific have confidence in Donald Trump to do the right thing regarding international affairs . Across the 13 countries surveyed , a median of 16 % have confidence in the American president . Just one-in-five or fewer in Canada and Western Europe trust the president to do what is right . In Belgium , Denmark , Germany and France , roughly one-in-ten have confidence in Trump . The countries surveyed with the highest confidence in Trump are both in the Asia-Pacific region , and ratings in these countries are still very low . Roughly one-quarter of people in Australia and Japan believe the president will do the right thing in international affairs .
Certain groups – such as those with higher levels of education and those who are social media users – are especially likely to note both the positive and negative impacts of technology .1 , 2 Across all 11 countries , adults with a secondary education or higher are more likely to say technology has made people more informed about current events relative to those who do not have a secondary education . Yet , in nine countries , those with higher levels of education are also more inclined to say technology has made people more subject to false information and rumors . More highly educated adults are also more likely to say technology has contributed to both political divisions and tolerance of opposing viewpoints in seven of these countries ( Colombia , India , Kenya , Lebanon , the Philippines , Tunisia and Vietnam ) .
While the ongoing storylines of the struggling economy and the incoming Obama administration were still in the spotlight , other stories rivaled them for attention . And in the end , for the first time in 2008 , no single story filled more than 15 % of the time studied on television or space online or on the nation 's front pages , according to the weekly News Coverage Index from the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism .
Publics are generally more worried than hopeful about the prospect that robots and computers may one day be able to do much of the work done by humans today . Their greatest concern is that automation will make it harder for ordinary people to find jobs . More than eight-in-ten adults in Greece , Argentina , Brazil , South Africa and Canada voice such worries , and more than seven-in-ten in Hungary , Poland , Italy and Japan agree . Many in the nations surveyed also believe that the greater use of robots and computers will worsen inequality between the rich and the poor . More than eight-in-ten in Greece , Argentina , Japan and Brazil express this view , as do more than seven-in-ten in Canada , South Africa , the U.S. and Hungary . Worsening inequality due to technological advances is a particular concern among the more highly educated in countries such as Japan , South Africa and Brazil . And less than half the publics surveyed believe that robots and computers doing much of the work currently done by humans would lead to new , better-paying jobs . In fact , only about a quarter of Americans and Italians and roughly a third of Japanese and Hungarians hold this view . Women are less hopeful than men in Canada , Japan and Brazil . And in Canada , Greece and Japan , those without a college education are less likely than the college-educated to say that automation will lead to new , better-paying jobs .
The full population picture does n't tell the whole story . If you look simply at the total percentage of online adults who say they trust a news organization for news about government and politics , several mainstream television outlets rise to the top . CNN , ABC , NBC , CBS and Fox News are all trusted by more than four-in-ten web-using U.S. adults . These high numbers , though , are intertwined with the fact that more than nine-in-ten respondents have heard of these five news sources . Trust and distrust were only asked of sources respondents had heard of , thus , the better known a source is , the more Americans in total who can voice trust or distrust of that source . A source like The Economist , on the other hand , is known by just 34 % of respondents and so could never have a trust level exceeding 34 % — even if everyone who had heard of it trusted it . What about the ratio of trust to distrust ? Another way to think of trust is to compare trust and distrust in a news source . In other words , what is the ratio of people who trust a news outlet to those who distrust it ? This ratio is based just on those who have rated the sources as trusted or distrusted , regardless of how well known the source is . The result is a different list of news brands : The Economist , BBC , NPR , PBS and The Wall Street Journal are among those with the highest ratio of trust to distrust – even if the overall percentages of those who trust them are smaller than for some other sources . Only 34 % of online Americans , for example , have heard of The Economist , but there is far more trust ( 12 % ) than distrust ( 2 % ) when it comes to news about government and politics ( 20 % neither trust nor distrust The Economist ) . The BBC is recognized by a greater portion of respondents ( 76 % ) , but is similarly more trusted ( 36 % ) than distrusted ( 7 % ) .
Catholics who attend Mass at least weekly are more likely than other Catholics to have opinions that align with church policies and teachings . But even among frequent churchgoers , majorities are open to non-traditional family arrangements . For example , roughly a third of Catholics who attend Mass weekly ( 34 % ) say children being raised by a same-sex couple is acceptable and as good as any other arrangement , which is similar to the share who see this as unacceptable ( 36 % ) .
A driving attitude of the Tea Party is a belief in smaller government : Fully 92 % of Tea Party Republicans prefer a smaller government with fewer services , just 5 % want a bigger government . Among non-Tea Party Republicans , a smaller government is preferred by a less one-sided 67 % -28 % margin .
Six-in-ten ( 60 % ) say the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has contributed a great deal to the size of the debt . About four-in-ten ( 42 % ) say the same about the condition of the national economy .
Opinions on these issues are related to one another ; for example , most of those who take the most conservative positions on abortion also oppose gay marriage , and a similar pattern is seen for each pair of items . But there is also a great deal of inconsistency . Just over one-in-ten Americans ( 12 % ) takes the conservative position on all of these items , and a somewhat larger number ( 22 % ) take conservative positions on none of the items . Thus , much of the public falls between the extremes on this collection of issues . About one-third of the respondents ( 34 % ) are squarely in the middle , taking two or three conservative positions out of a possible five ; 16 % are mostly liberal ( taking only one conservative opinion ) and 16 % are mostly conservative ( taking four conservative opinions ) .
Amid all the mistrust and recriminations , the Pew surveys turned up a number of positive trends in Muslim public opinion , most notably a sharp decline in support for suicide bombing . The share of Muslims who found suicide bombing as a justified means of defending Islam fell throughout the period from 2002 to 2008 . In Lebanon , 74 % of Muslims considered suicide bombing as justified in 2002 , but that percentage tumbled to 32 % in 2008 . Pakistani support for suicide bombing plunged from 33 % to 5 % .
The Turkish public is more divided on Erdogan 's handling of the economy , with 49 % saying they disapprove of the prime minister 's economic stewardship and 46 % approving . As with other judgments on Erdogan and government influence , Turkish Muslims who are more devout show greater approval of Erdogan 's job performance compared with those who are less religious .
African immigrants make up a small share of the nation 's immigrant population , but their overall numbers are growing – roughly doubling every decade since 1970 , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data . There were 2.1 million African immigrants living in the United States in 2015 , up from 881,000 in 2000 and a substantial increase from 1970 when the U.S. was home to only 80,000 foreign-born Africans . They accounted for 4.8 % of the U.S. immigrant population in 2015 , up from 0.8 % in 1970 .
Coverage of the health care debate filled 11 % of the newshole last week , according to the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism ( PEJ ) . The Fort Hood shootings received more coverage ( 20 % ) , while 21 % of the public followed the investigation into the killings more closely than any other news in the week following the Nov. 5 rampage .
However , women and men who were employed in the past two years are equally likely to say that they have taken time off to care for a sick family member during that time , but women report having taken slightly more time off , on average , than men . And women are much more likely than men to say that they were the primary caregiver for their sick family member . Roughly two-thirds ( 65 % ) of female family-leave takers say they provided more care for their sick family member than anyone else in the family . Only 44 % of male family-leave takers say they were the main caregiver .
As trust in the federal government has declined since the start of the year , anger has risen . Currently , 30 % say they are angry at the government , up 11 points since January . The share saying they are basically content with government has fallen by eight points , while frustration has held about steady .
While Obama 's support levels have not increased much in recent weeks , a growing percentage of his backers now say they support him strongly . Currently , 74 % of Obama voters say they support him strongly , up from 65 % in mid-September . A much smaller majority of McCain backers ( 56 % ) say they support him strongly , which is largely unchanged from mid-September .
Regionally , Russia 's reputation is least favorable in Europe and North America . A full 63 % of Americans and 59 % of Canadians hold negative views of Russia . In Europe , a median of 61 % feel the same , with anti-Russian sentiment particularly intense in the Netherlands ( 82 % ) and Sweden ( 78 % ) . In the Middle East , majorities in Jordan ( 93 % ) , Turkey ( 62 % ) and Israel ( 61 % ) hold negative views of Russia . Anti-Russian sentiment in Jordan has nearly doubled over the past decade – intensifying even before Russia 's involvement in the Syrian conflict .
Most Americans attribute the series of public sex scandals in recent years involving politicians more to the heightened scrutiny they face than to lower moral standards among elected officials . A 57 % -majority says elected officials just get caught more often because they are under greater scrutiny . About two-in-ten ( 19 % ) , on the other hand , say elected officials have lower moral standards than ordinary Americans , according to the latest national survey conducted June 9 - 12 among 1,002 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press and The Washington Post . Among the 19 % who attribute the scandals to lower moral standards among elected officials , most ( 13 % of the public ) say that when people get into positions of power , they tend to lose their moral standards , while 4 % say that politics attracts the kind of people who have lower moral standards .
About six-in-ten women in the U.S. ( 59 % ) say they have been sexually harassed . Women with at least some college education are far more likely than those with less education to say they have experienced harassment . Non-Hispanic white women are also more likely than women in other racial and ethnic groups to cite such experiences . Around a quarter of men ( 27 % ) say they have been sexually harassed .
There has been an overall increase in concern about the problems of crime , corrupt officials and poor quality schools in the emerging and developing nations surveyed in 2007 and 2014 . For instance , in 2007 , a median of 64 % said crime was a very big problem across those 20 countries , but in 2014 , 74 % do . An almost identical change has occurred for the problem of corruption . And in 2007 , a median of only 38 % across these countries named poor quality schools as a big concern . Now , about half say this .
The number of black journalists working at U.S. daily newspapers has dropped 40 % since 1997 , according to the latest data from the American Society of News Editors . That represents a loss of almost 1,200 journalists — from 2,946 in 1997 to 1,754 in 2013 . It 's also a steeper decline than the rate of job losses for white journalists — a 34 % decrease during the same time period . In the last 16 years , the ranks of Hispanic and Asian journalists have also declined , though not as steeply — losing 13 % and 2 % , respectively .
More than four-in-ten ( 45 % ) say they followed news about the condition of the economy very closely last week . The economic crisis accounted for 18 % of the newshole . About four-in-ten ( 39 % ) say they followed the debate over health care reform very closely , a level little changed in recent weeks . While the health care debate was a significant part of assessments of Obama 's speech and his first year in office , stories that focused primarily on this debate made up just 3 % of the coverage analyzed by PEJ . A third of Americans ( 33 % ) say they followed news about Obama 's State of the Union speech very closely , a level comparable to the 37 % that said they followed his first speech to Congress on Feb. 24 , 2009 very closely . In early 2008 , just 18 % said they followed George W. Bush 's last State of the Union address very closely . This year , 8 % say they followed the speech more closely than any other major story ; reporting on the speech made up 19 % of the newshole . About two-in-ten ( 21 % ) say they followed news about the widespread recall of Toyota cars and trucks – and a temporary halt to sales of certain models – because of problems with sudden acceleration . Just 5 % say this is the story they followed most closely . Toyota 's troubles made up 4 % of the newshole .
Majority says significant changes are needed in structure of government . A 62 % majority of the public says that significant changes are needed in the fundamental design and structure of American government to make it work for current times ; 37 % say the design and structure of government serves the country well , and significant changes are not needed . While views among the public overall have changed little since 2018 , Democrats and Republicans have moved further apart in their opinions . Currently , 79 % of Democrats say significant changes in the structure of government are needed , compared with 41 % of Republicans .
Currently , 48 % say the U.S. is a less important and powerful world leader than it was 10 years ago ; 34 % think the U.S. is as important and powerful as it was a decade ago while 15 % think it is more important . In November , 53 % said the U.S. was less important globally , while 27 % said it was as important ( 17 % said it was more important ) .
Today , men and women are equally likely to be internet users , a trend that has not wavered throughout the 15 years these surveys have been conducted . However , the earliest Pew Research surveys found that men were more likely than women to be internet users . For instance , a 1995 survey found 9 % of men and 4 % of women had used a `` modem to connect to any computer bulletin boards , information services such as Compuserve or Prodigy . '' By 2000 , when Pew Research began tracking internet use more consistently , 54 % of men were internet users , compared with half of women . This modest gap continued , gradually shrinking until 2008 when a statistically indistinguishable 74 % of men and 73 % of women identified as internet users . Today , 85 % of men and 84 % of women report being internet users .
While Americans ' views of the UN have remained generally stable overall since 2007 , Democrats and Republicans consistently express differing views about the organization , and the size of the partisan gap has increased over time . This year , for example , 85 % of Democrats are positive on the UN , compared with just 39 % of Republicans , a difference of 46 percentage points .
Japanese and South Koreans expect the U.S. to come to their aid in the event of a conflict with North Korea – and Americans support such a move . Two close neighbors of North Korea , Japan and South Korea , are also U.S. treaty allies , meaning that if North Korea used military force against them , the U.S. would be obligated to defend them . In both countries , large majorities expect this would happen : 91 % of South Koreans expect U.S. assistance in the event of a military conflict with North Korea , and 82 % of Japanese say the same . Nearly two-thirds of Americans ( 64 % ) say the U.S. should use military force to defend its allies in Asia in the event that they get into a serious military conflict with North Korea .
Historically , women have been especially avid users . Between December 2009 and December 2012 , women were significantly more likely than men to use social networking sites in nine out of ten surveys we conducted . During this period , the proportion of women who used social media sites was 10 percentage points higher than men on average . When we include earlier surveys and our latest reading ( spanning May 2008 through May 2013 ) , the average difference falls slightly to 8 % . Currently , three-quarters ( 74 % ) of online women use social networking sites .
Amid this tension between personal privacy and public safety , 52 % of Americans surveyed in early April say it is at least somewhat acceptable for the government to use people 's cellphones to track the location of those who have tested positive for the virus to understand how the virus is spreading , but a similar share ( 48 % ) believes this is very or somewhat unacceptable to do . At the same time , 45 % of the public says it is acceptable for the government to use cellphones to track the location of people who may have had contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 , while a somewhat larger share ( 54 % ) describes this type of tracking as unacceptable . By comparison , there is less support for monitoring mobile devices to make sure people are following social distancing guidelines . Some 37 % of Americans say it is at least somewhat acceptable for the government to use people 's cellphones to track the location of people to ensure they are complying with experts ' advice on limiting social contact during the coronavirus outbreak . But a much larger share ( 62 % ) believes this type of cellphone tracking is very ( 43 % ) or somewhat ( 20 % ) unacceptable .
A recent Pew Research Center survey shows that neither world power has a clear advantage when it comes to the hearts and minds of people in Africa . Among the seven sub-Saharan African countries polled this year , at least six-in-ten in each nation say they have a favorable view of the U.S. , including roughly three-quarters or more in Kenya , Ghana , Tanzania and Senegal . Broad majorities also rate China positively . The one exception is South Africa – just 45 % express a favorable view of China , compared with 68 % for the U.S .
The recent surge of refugees into Europe has featured prominently in the anti-immigrant rhetoric of right-wing parties across the Continent and in the heated debate over the UK 's decision to exit the European Union . At the same time , attacks in Paris and Brussels have fueled public fears about terrorism . As a new Pew Research Center survey illustrates , the refugee crisis and the threat of terrorism are very much related to one another in the minds of many Europeans . In eight of the 10 European nations surveyed , half or more believe incoming refugees increase the likelihood of terrorism in their country . But terrorism is not the only concern people have about refugees . Many are also worried that they will be an economic burden . Half or more in five nations say refugees will take away jobs and social benefits . Hungarians , Poles , Greeks , Italians and French identify this as their greatest concern . Sweden and Germany are the only countries where at least half say refugees make their nation stronger because of their work and talents . Fears linking refugees and crime are much less pervasive , although nearly half in Italy and Sweden say refugees are more to blame for crime than other groups .
But while the public backs airstrikes , there is widespread concern about the U.S. becoming too involved in Iraq . Overall , 51 % say their greater concern about military action is that the U.S. will go too far getting involved in the situation . Fewer ( 32 % ) say they are more concerned that the U.S. will not go far enough in stopping Islamic militants .
Across the countries surveyed , a median of 45 % say fewer or no immigrants should be allowed to move to their country , while 36 % say they want about the same number of immigrants . Just 14 % say their countries should allow more immigrants . ( Those who said no immigrants should be allowed volunteered this response . ) In Europe , majorities in Greece ( 82 % ) , Hungary ( 72 % ) , Italy ( 71 % ) and Germany ( 58 % ) say fewer immigrants or no immigrants at all should be allowed to move to their countries . Each of these countries served as some of the most popular transit or destination countries during Europe 's recent surge in asylum seekers . ( In several countries , most disapprove of how the European Union has handled the refugee issue . ) People in other countries around the world hold views similar to those in Europe . Large majorities in Israel ( 73 % ) , Russia ( 67 % ) , South Africa ( 65 % ) and Argentina ( 61 % ) say their countries should let in fewer immigrants . In every country surveyed , less than a third say their nation should allow more immigrants to enter .
Supporters and opponents see Clinton 's political views differently . About six-in-ten voters ( 58 % ) in our latest American Trends Panel survey say Clinton 's views are liberal on most or almost all issues , while nearly three-in-ten ( 28 % ) say she has a mix of liberal and conservative views . Yet there is a large gap in how Trump and Clinton supporters describe her views . About three-quarters of Trump supporters ( 78 % ) say Clinton has predominantly liberal views , including 59 % who say she is liberal on almost all issues . By contrast , Clinton 's supporters are just as likely to say she has a mix of liberal and conservative views ( 42 % ) as to say her positions are predominantly liberal ( 42 % ) . Just 9 % say she 's liberal on almost all issues .
Among whites , Trump won an overwhelming share of those without a college degree ; and among white college graduates – a group that many identified as key for a potential Clinton victory – Trump outperformed Clinton by a narrow 4-point margin .
Obama 's approval ratings continue to differ by generation , with younger generations more likely to view his job performance positively . Currently 55 % of Millennials ( those now ages 18 - 34 ) approve of his job performance , as do half of Generation Xers ( those 35 to 50 ) . By comparison , 44 % of Baby Boomers ( 51 to 69 year olds ) approve of Obama , along with just 37 % of those in the Silent Generation ( currently ages 70 to 87 ) .
Only three-in-ten ( 31 % ) Latinos rate immigration as an `` extremely important '' issue facing the incoming Obama administration , placing it sixth on a list of seven policy priorities that respondents were asked to assess in a nationwide survey of 1,007 Latino adults conducted from December 3 to December 10 , 2008 by the Pew Hispanic Center , a project of the Pew Research Center . The top-rated issue among Latinos is the economy ; 57 % of Hispanics say it is an extremely important one for the new president to address . Education , health care , national security and the environment all also rate higher than immigration as a policy priority among Hispanics , while energy policy ranks lower . Latinos , who make up 15 % of the U.S. population , are by far the nation 's biggest immigrant group . According to Pew Hispanic Center tabulations of the 2006 American Community Survey , more than half ( 55 % ) of Latinos ages 18 and older are immigrants , and 47 % of all immigrants ages 18 and older are Hispanic . Even at the apex of the congressional debate over immigration reform in 2007 , however , the issue never rose to the top of Latinos ' priority list . Of six issues asked of Latinos in a 2007 Pew Hispanic Center survey , it ranked fifth . But back then , 38 % of Hispanics judged immigration to be an extremely important issue—more than the 31 % who say the same thing in the new survey .
Since then , there has been a sharp rise in the share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who approve of the health care law ( from 71 % then to 85 % today ) . By contrast , there has been very little change in views among Republicans ( 13 % approved of the law then , 14 % today ) .
In a survey conducted in fall 2018 , more than four-in-five Lebanese adults ( 84 % ) said they use WhatsApp , the highest rate among 11 emerging economies included in the survey . It is the most commonly used social network or messaging platform in Lebanon , beating out Facebook , Instagram and other platforms .
People in Turkey think that their country should garner more respect around the world than it currently does . In all , 54 % of Turks say they deserve more respect compared with the 36 % who think Turkey is as respected as it should be .
The public remains deeply dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country . Just 26 % are satisfied with national conditions , while 71 % are dissatisfied . And it has muted expectations for the year to come : 49 % say they think 2015 will be a better year than 2014 , while 42 % think it will be worse . The current ratings are more pessimistic than in recent years , as the public generally takes an optimistic view of the year to come . A year ago , 56 % thought 2014 would be a better year than the last , compared with fewer ( 35 % ) who thought it would be worse . The current seven-point gap in expectations for a better ( 49 % ) than worse ( 42 % ) year is the narrowest margin measured in Pew Research Center surveys dating to 1994 .
These findings vary by age . Roughly half of social media users ages 18 to 24 ( 51 % ) say it would be hard to give up social media , but just one-third of users ages 50 and older feel similarly . The data also fit broadly with other findings the Center has collected about Americans ' attitudes toward social media . Despite using them for a wide range of reasons , just 3 % of social media users indicate that they have a lot of trust in the information they find on these sites . And relatively few have confidence in these platforms to keep their personal information safe from bad actors .
In other news this week , 28 % of the public paid very close attention to the situation in Iraq , while 22 % closely followed the debate in Washington about Iraq policy . Interest in the 2008 presidential campaign was unchanged from the previous week – 18 % followed news about the candidates very closely , and another 28 % followed campaign news fairly closely . Democrats continue to follow the campaign more closely than Republicans .
These are among the findings of a national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press that tests reactions to words and phrases frequently used in current political discourse . Overall , 29 % say they have a positive reaction to the word `` socialism , '' while 59 % react negatively . The public 's impressions of `` capitalism , '' though far more positive , are somewhat mixed . Slightly more than half ( 52 % ) react positively to the word `` capitalism , '' compared with 37 % who say they have a negative reaction . The survey , conducted April 21 - 26 among 1,546 adults , measured reactions to nine political words and phrases . The most positive reactions are to `` family values '' ( 89 % positive ) and `` civil rights '' ( 87 % ) . About three-quarters see `` states ' rights '' ( 77 % ) and `` civil liberties '' ( 76 % ) positively , while 68 % have a positive reaction to the word `` progressive . '' Reactions to the word `` libertarian '' are evenly divided – 38 % positive , 37 % negative . On balance , Republicans view `` libertarian '' negatively , Democrats are divided , while independents have a positive impression of the term . `` Militia '' elicits the most negative reaction of the nine terms tested : Just 21 % have a positive reaction compared with 65 % who have a negative response .
But more generally , Americans are somewhat skeptical about the value of a college degree in the job market : Only 16 % of all U.S. adults – including 13 % of those with at least a four-year college degree – say that a bachelor 's degree prepares students `` very well '' for a well-paying job in today 's economy , while an additional 51 % say it prepares students somewhat well . And 12 % say a two-year associate degree prepares students very well ( with 46 % saying it prepares them somewhat well ) . About a quarter of Americans ( 26 % ) say that certification programs in a professional , technical or vocational field prepares students very well ( 52 % say somewhat well ) .
Most Russians say that Western sanctions are having an effect on their economy , and nearly half ( 47 % ) say it is a major effect . This concern is little changed from surveys in 2015 and 2017 . Relatedly , 80 % of Russians see NATO as a military threat , with 45 % stating it is a major threat . Similar sentiments toward the organization were shared in 2015 and 2017 .
Since we began polling the Turkish people in 2002 , shortly after the 9/11 attacks , never have more than three-in-ten said they have a favorable view of the U.S . But anti-Americanism really spiked in the aftermath of the 2003 Iraq War , when 83 % of Turks held a negative view of America . Today , only 19 % in Turkey like the U.S. , while nearly three-quarters ( 73 % ) share a dislike of their NATO ally . ( Unfortunately , we do not have comparable data for American views of Turkey ) . But Turkish distaste for foreign powers does not begin and end with the U.S. On balance , around two-thirds or more Turks express unfavorable views of the European Union , China , Brazil , Russia , Iran and Israel . Turks even dislike Saudi Arabia ( 53 % unfavorable and , notably , the highest favorability percentage ( 26 % ) among all countries we asked about ) . The people of Turkey also hold negative views toward NATO specifically ( 70 % dislike the organization ) . In fact , it is hard to find any country or organization the Turkish people really like , except , of course , Turkey itself . According to our spring 2012 poll , 78 % of Turks said they had a favorable view of their country .
Indeed , a majority of members of the national legislative bodies in five predominantly English-speaking countries have a Twitter account . But as is true among other types of Twitter users , a modest number of active tweeters produce an outsize share of legislative tweets . A new analysis by Pew Research Center finds that the one-quarter of legislators who are most active on the site produce a majority of all tweets from this group – both overall and within each individual country .
The public 's views of local job availability continue to improve . Currently , 50 % of Americans say there are plenty of jobs available in their communities – the highest number saying that jobs are plentiful in Pew Research Center surveys dating to 2001 . Since June 2016 , the share saying plenty of jobs are available has increased seven percentage points , from 43 % to 50 % , with virtually all of the change coming among Republicans . Yet in both parties , perceptions of the local job situation are much more positive today than they were three or four years ago .
As violence and chaos spreads in Iraq , the public is wary of U.S. involvement in the country . A 55 % majority says the United States does not have a responsibility to do something about the violence in Iraq ; 39 % do see a responsibility to act . The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center , conducted July 8 - 14 among 1,805 adults , finds that a majority of the public ( 55 % ) thinks that religious and ethnic rivalries in Iraq have contributed a lot to the current violence and instability in the country . About four-in-ten ( 39 % ) think the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops has been a major contributing factor , while somewhat fewer ( 32 % ) say the U.S.-led war in Iraq has contributed a lot to the country 's violence and instability .
In recent weeks , President Obama has been on the road citing the need for programs that bolster the middle-class . But having weathered a recession that staggered the economy , a 2012 survey shows Americans have changed their views on what it takes to be part of the middle-class . Nearly nine-in-ten adults ( 86 % ) say a person needs a secure job to be considered part of the middle class , while just 45 % say the same about owning a home , 37 % about a college education and 28 % about financial investments . Of the five items tested in the survey question , the only other one seen as essential to a middle-class lifestyle by a majority of the public is health insurance—which many Americans receive through their work . Two-thirds of adults say it 's an essential requirement of a middle-class lifestyle .
Chinese views of Russia have also dipped in the past year . About half of Chinese ( 51 % ) have a favorable opinion of Russia , down from nearly two-thirds in 2014 . But the Chinese public 's views of Russia have merely returned to their long-term norm after a one-year spike . Meanwhile , Russian views of China have improved markedly , rising from 64 % in 2014 – roughly the level they had been at since 2007 – to 79 % .
Before each round , respondents saw probabilistic forecasts and vote share projections for their team . Sometimes these numbers were closer to 50 - 50 , sometimes they depicted large margins or high odds . The exact numbers were selected based on random assignment , though both vote share and probability for a team had to be either below or above 50 % – for example , a team might be assigned a projected 56 % of the vote and a 63 % chance of winning . Results showed that probabilistic forecasts with higher odds of one candidate winning resulted in people not expending resources necessary to cast a vote in the game . In contrast , the size of vote share projections had no detectable effect on voting in the game .
These are among the findings of the weekly News Coverage Index , a comprehensive analysis of the press coverage the week of Nov. 3 - 9 from the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism .
As part of his economic agenda , Peña Nieto proposed allowing private international investment in the oil and gas industry for the first time in over 75 years , legislation that was recently finalized by the Mexican Congress . Under the new laws , private companies will be able to conduct oil exploration in Mexico , including through partnerships with Pemex , the state-owned petroleum company . The survey asked whether respondents support or oppose allowing companies from other countries to invest in Pemex . A majority of Mexicans ( 57 % ) oppose opening up Pemex to foreign businesses . Only about a third ( 34 % ) approve . Even PRI supporters are divided ( 44 % support vs. 46 % oppose ) .
A growing share of Americans have heard of the group of conspiracy theories known as QAnon , and a substantial portion of Republicans who are aware of it say it is a good thing for the country . The share of U.S. adults who have heard or read at least a little about QAnon rose from 23 % in February to 47 % in September . Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who are aware of QAnon overwhelmingly see it as a very or somewhat bad thing for the country ( 90 % say this ) , but Republicans and GOP leaners are more divided . Half of Republicans who are aware of QAnon say it is a very or somewhat bad thing for the nation , while 41 % say it is a very or somewhat good thing .
However , the public is not optimistic about the direction of the national economy over the next year . As many say that economic conditions will be worse in a year ( 22 % ) as say they will be better ( 22 % ) ; 54 % say the economy will be about the same a year from now . Republicans and Democrats differ significantly in their economic expectations . More Democrats expect the economy to be better in a year ( 31 % ) than worse ( 11 % ) ; 56 % say conditions will be the same . Among Republicans , 31 % say the economy will be worse in a year compared with 15 % who think it will be better ; 51 % say it will be about the same .
America 's demographic changes are shifting the electorate – and American politics . The 2016 electorate will be the most diverse in U.S. history due to strong growth among Hispanic eligible voters , particularly U.S.-born youth . There are also wide gaps opening up between the generations on many social and political issues . Young adult Millennials are much more likely than their elders to hold liberal views on many political and social issues , though they are also less likely to identify with either political party : 50 % call themselves political independents .
In advance of Friday 's jobs report , the public 's assessment of job availability in their local communities has improved modestly . But that has done nothing to boost overall economic optimism . The new national survey by the Pew Research Center , conducted August 20 - 24 among 1,501 adults finds that 33 % say there are plenty of jobs available where they live , while 58 % say that jobs are difficult to find . The share saying jobs are available has ticked up from 29 % in July and 27 % in April . Nearly two years ago , in December 2012 , just 22 % said there were plenty of jobs locally .
The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act made significant changes to U.S. immigration policy by sweeping away a long-standing national origins quota system that favored immigrants from Europe and replacing it with one that emphasized family reunification and skilled immigrants . At the time , relatively few anticipated the size or demographic impact of the post-1965 immigration flow ( Gjelten , 2015 ) . In absolute numbers , the roughly 59 million immigrants who arrived in the U.S. between 1965 and 2015 exceed those who arrived in the great waves of European-dominated immigration during the 19th and early 20th centuries . Between 1840 and 1889 , 14.3 million immigrants came to the U.S. , and between 1890 and 1919 , an additional 18.2 million arrived ( see Table 1 for details ) . As a result of its changed makeup and rapid growth , new immigration since 1965 has altered the nation 's racial and ethnic composition . In 1965 , 84 % of Americans were non-Hispanic whites . By 2015 , that share had declined to 62 % . Meanwhile , the Hispanic share of the U.S. population rose from 4 % in 1965 to 18 % in 2015 . Asians also saw their share rise , from less than 1 % in 1965 to 6 % in 2015 . The Pew Research analysis shows that without any post-1965 immigration , the nation 's racial and ethnic composition would be very different today : 75 % white , 14 % black , 8 % Hispanic and less than 1 % Asian .
Public attitudes about the economy have turned bleak in much of the world as the coronavirus outbreak continues to affect daily life , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted this summer in 14 nations in Europe , North America and the Asia-Pacific region . Assessments of national economies have seen swift downturns in many countries , and few see improvements anytime soon amid what the International Monetary Fund calls a `` crisis like no other . '' Overall , a median of only 31 % of adults across the surveyed nations assess their country 's current economic situation as good , while 68 % say conditions are bad . In Europe , attitudes are mixed . Generally , Northern Europeans surveyed have more positive assessments , with a majority of Danes , Swedes and Dutch rating their country 's economic condition positively . Germans are split ( 51 % good , 47 % bad ) . In the rest of the European countries surveyed – Belgium , the UK , France , Spain and Italy – large majorities rate economic conditions negatively .
Around three-quarters of Americans say the Chinese government 's initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan contributed either a great deal ( 51 % ) or a fair amount ( 27 % ) to the global spread of the virus . Republicans are particularly critical : 73 % believe China 's early handling of the pandemic contributed a great deal to its spread , compared with 38 % of Democrats who say the same . Older people , too , are especially likely to lay the blame on China . Half of Americans think the U.S. should hold China responsible for the role it played in the outbreak of the coronavirus , even if it means worsening economic relations , while 38 % think the U.S. should prioritize strong U.S.-China relations , even if it means overlooking any role China played in the outbreak . ( The 8 % of adults who say the Chinese government 's initial handling of the virus is not at all to blame for the global spread of the virus were not asked this foll0w-up question , while 5 % expressed no opinion , either to the first or second question . ) Republicans and those who lean toward the GOP are about twice as likely ( 71 % ) as Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 37 % ) to say the U.S. should hold China responsible even at the expense of worse economic relations .
A Pew Research Center survey conducted Nov. 28-Dec .5 2012 found that 55 % of Americans have received government benefits from at least one of the six best-known federal entitlement programs . ( In addition to Social Security and Medicare , they are unemployment benefits , food stamps , Medicaid and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families , commonly referred to as `` welfare . '' Of the major programs , unemployment benefits and Social Security are the most used . )
Concerns about immigration deeply divide remainers and leavers . A majority ( 57 % ) of the British public said they favor more restrictions on entry into the UK . People who reported voting `` leave '' were much more likely than those who reported voting `` remain '' to favor more restrictive immigration . Big majorities of Conservative identifiers and people on the political right similarly supported more restrictions on immigration , but to a lesser extent than `` leave '' voters . While only three-in-ten people on the political left supported more restrictive immigration , Labour supporters were nearly evenly split : 49 % were in favor and 51 % were not .
With growing conflicts engulfing the Middle East , people in the region name religious and ethnic hatred most frequently as the greatest threat to the world . Moreover , publics across the globe see the threat of religious and ethnic violence as a growing threat to the world 's future . But in Europe , concerns about inequality trump all other dangers and the gap between the rich and the poor is increasingly considered the world 's top problem by people living in advanced economies , including the United States . Elsewhere , Asians and Latin Americans are somewhat divided about the world 's greatest danger , but pollution and environmental problems as well as the spread of nuclear weapons are high on their list of threats . African countries see AIDS and other infectious diseases as the most pressing issue in the world today . Around a quarter of Americans say the growing gap between the rich and the poor ( 27 % ) is the greatest threat to the world today , with 24 % saying this about religious and ethnic hatred and 23 % expressing concern about the spread of nuclear weapons . Fewer say pollution and other environmental problems ( 15 % ) or AIDS and other infectious diseases ( 7 % ) are the world 's top problems .
The steady drip of negative news from Iraq is significantly undermining support for the U.S. military operation there . With the number of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq exceeding 1,700 , there is widespread awareness of the rising American death toll . As a consequence , baseline public attitudes toward the war are gradually turning more negative . Support for an immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq continues to inch up ­ from 36 % last October , to 42 % in February , and 46 % currently .
The share of births outside of marriage declined for immigrant women from 2008 to 2014 , but held steady for U.S.-born women . Immigrant women play an important role in overall U.S. fertility trends . Between 1970 and 2014 , the increase in the annual number of U.S. births was driven entirely by immigrant women , while births to U.S.-born women fell . The important role of immigrant women in driving U.S. births stems from both the growth in the foreign-born population and the fact that immigrant women have , on average , more children than U.S.-born women .
In a multivariate analysis to see which factors matter most in predicting those who may or will not participate in the census , age is the most important predictor . Even when controlling for other demographic characteristics , analysis finds that younger Americans are more likely to say they might not participate . For those younger than age 30 , the probability of likely non-participation is .18 , compared with a probability of only .04 for those age 50 and older . Education also is a factor in predicted census participation , even controlling for age and other demographic characteristics . For those with a high school education or less , the probability of not participating is .11 whereas those with a college education have a probability of .05 . Gender , party and race and ethnicity are not significantly related to whether someone might not participate . And after controlling for other demographic characteristics , income and home ownership , are not significantly related to intention to participate .
Roughly four-in-ten adults who describe themselves as bisexual ( 43 % ) say they are sexually attracted to men and women equally . A similar share ( 40 % ) say they are attracted mostly to the opposite gender and 4 % report feeling attracted only to the opposite gender , while 12 % and 1 % , respectively , say they are attracted mostly or only to their own gender . Among people who identify as straight or heterosexual , the vast majority ( 96 % ) say they are attracted only to the opposite gender , and a small share ( 3 % , mostly made up of women ) say they are mostly attracted to the opposite gender . Gays and lesbians are somewhat less likely to report being solely attracted to one gender . Still , most ( 81 % ) are attracted solely to the same gender while 14 % are attracted mostly to the same gender .
Overall , 71 % of Americans said that any voter should have the option to vote early or absentee without having to document a reason , including 60 % of those living in states that do not have early voting , no-excuse absentee voting or voting by mail . Three-quarters of those living in states that had such voting accommodations said any voter should have the option of voting early or absentee without needing a reason . As with some other attitudes , there are partisan differences : 83 % of Democrats across the country think voters should be able to vote early or absentee without an excuse , compared with 57 % of Republicans .
Boys are more likely than girls to report that they visit Facebook most often ( 45 % of boys vs. 36 % of girls ) . Girls are more likely than boys to say they use Instagram ( 23 % of girls vs. 17 % of boys ) and Tumblr ( 6 % of girls compared with less than 1 % of boys ) . Older teens ages 15 to 17 are more likely than younger teens to cite Facebook ( 44 % vs. 35 % of younger teens ) , Snapchat ( 13 % vs. 8 % ) and Twitter ( 8 % vs. 3 % ) as a most often used platform , while younger teens ages 13 to 14 are more likely than their older compatriots to list Instagram ( 25 % vs. 17 % of older teens ) as a platform they visit most often . Teenage girls use social media sites and platforms — particularly visually-oriented ones — for sharing more than their male counterparts do . For their part , boys are more likely than girls to own gaming consoles and play video games . Data for this report was collected for Pew Research Center . The survey was administered online by the GfK Group using its KnowledgePanel , in English and Spanish , to a nationally representative sample of over 1,060 teens ages 13 to 17 and a parent or guardian from September 25 to October 9 , 2014 and February 10 to March 16 , 2015 . In the fall , 1016 parent-teen pairs were interviewed . The survey was re-opened in the spring and 44 pairs were added to the sample . For more on the methods for this study , please visit the Methods section at the end of this report .
Majorities view unions , corporations favorably A majority of the public ( 55 % ) now holds a favorable view of labor unions , while 33 % hold an unfavorable view . The share with a favorable view is down slightly from last year ( 60 % ) , but much higher than in 2011 , when just 41 % viewed unions favorably .
As it turned out , the U.S. economy began to recover that summer , although growth has been modest at best and the middle class has n't seen much benefit . The unemployment rate , which peaked at 10 % in October 2009 , stood at 5 % last month , its lowest level in nearly eight years . However , millions of Americans have left the labor force entirely , due to retirement , disability , despair at finding work or other reasons . The employment-to-population ratio , which was 60.6 % in January 2009 , bottomed out at 58.2 % in the summer of 2011 , and had recovered only to 59.5 % by last month .
Supporters of Donald Trump and Joe Biden are divided not just in their views of the two presidential candidates and in their broader political beliefs and values . They are also largely divided in their personal relationships : Roughly four-in-ten registered voters in both camps say that they do not have a single close friend who supports the other major party candidate , and fewer than a quarter say they have more than a few friends who do , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in July and August . Most voters instead report having a lot of friends who share their political preferences . Around six-in-ten Trump supporters ( 59 % ) say they have a lot of friends who share their support for the president 's reelection bid , while a slightly smaller share of Biden supporters ( 48 % ) say a lot of their close friends also back the former vice president in the election this fall . Nearly nine-in-ten backers of both Trump ( 89 % ) and Biden ( 87 % ) say they have at least some close friends who support their candidate for president .
Republicans ( 21 % ) are somewhat more likely than Democrats ( 15 % ) to say that the pandemic has financially helped news organizations a little or a lot . The same pattern appears in the shares who say it has not had much economic impact ( 21 % of Republicans say no impact vs. 15 % of Democrats ) .
This comparison of hundreds of individual survey questions , with and without the offline population , found that for most of the topics studied by Pew Research Center , the size of the bias caused by excluding the non-Web respondents is quite small . Across 406 separate survey items , only nine yielded estimates that differed by 5 or more percentage points . More than two-thirds of the 406 items yielded estimates with a 0 or 1 point difference . This is a consequence of the fact that the non-Web survey group is a small share of the total population , as well as the fact that the size of the differences between the Web and non-Web groups tends to be relatively modest on most questions .
Hispanics are the fastest-growing major racial or ethnic group in local police departments in the United States . In 2013 , Hispanics made up 12 % of full-time sworn officers , up 7 percentage points since the late 1980s , according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics . And they are still underrepresented relative to their share of the U.S. population , while black officers have gained parity on this measure .
In the predominantly Muslim countries surveyed , anger toward the United States remains pervasive , although the level of hatred has eased somewhat and support for the war on terrorism has inched up . Osama bin Laden , however , is viewed favorably by large percentages in Pakistan ( 65 % ) , Jordan ( 55 % ) and Morocco ( 45 % ) . Even in Turkey , where bin Laden is highly unpopular , as many as 31 % say that suicide attacks against Americans and other Westerners in Iraq are justifiable . Majorities in all four Muslim nations surveyed doubt the sincerity of the war on terrorism . Instead , most say it is an effort to control Mideast oil and to dominate the world .
Americans differ over the role and value of scientific experts in policy matters . While confidence in scientists overall tilts positive , people 's perspectives about the role and value of scientific experts on policy issues tends to vary . Six-in-ten U.S. adults believe that scientists should take an active role in policy debates about scientific issues , while about four-in-ten ( 39 % ) say , instead , that scientists should focus on establishing sound scientific facts and stay out of such debates .
The disproportionately young profile of Latinos in the U.S. is driven by the overwhelming youth of U.S.-born Hispanics . With a median age of 19 , nearly half ( 47 % ) of U.S.-born Latinos are younger than 18 . This is similar to the youth share among the nation 's other major racial or ethnic group with a large immigrant population – U.S.-born Asians , of whom 49 % are younger than 18 . By comparison , just 27 % of U.S.-born blacks and 20 % of U.S.-born whites are younger than 18 . Among the country 's Latinos , the immigrant and U.S.-born populations have very different age patterns . Few immigrants arrive as children . As a result , just 6 % of immigrant Latinos are younger than 18 . Most immigrants arrive as working-age adults . Some 26 % of Latino immigrants in 2014 were Millennials and a 37 % plurality were Gen Xers ( ages 34 to 49 ) . Another quarter of foreign-born Latinos ( 24 % ) were Boomers ( ages 50 to 68 ) .
Americans are concerned about the economic threat from China , and their top worries about China revolve around economic issues . When respondents to a 2012 Pew Research Center/Carnegie Endowment for International Peace survey were asked to rate potential concerns about China , the top three issues were all economic : 78 % described the large amount of U.S. debt held by China as a very serious problem , 71 % said this about job losses to China , and 61 % felt this way about the trade deficit with China . Cyberattacks , China 's impact on the environment , its growing military power , and its human rights policies were all rated lower , although these issues generated strong concerns among many as well .
Obama 's job approval measure has fallen eight points since December , from 55 % to 47 % . His rating is comparable to George W. Bush 's ( 45 % ) at the same point early in his second term and is much lower than Bill Clinton 's 60 % rating in February 1997 .
A 20-public median of 48 % say genetically modified , or GM , foods are unsafe to eat , while a much smaller median of 13 % say GM foods are safe . The survey included an option for people with limited familiarity about GM foods to indicate this ; a median of 37 % say they do n't know enough to offer a view about the safety of GM foods . Majorities in places such as Russia ( 70 % ) , Italy ( 62 % ) , India ( 58 % ) and South Korea ( 57 % ) view GM foods as generally unsafe to eat . The balance of opinion tilts negative even in places where sizable shares say they do n't know enough about GM foods to offer a view . For example , 47 % of Spaniards say GM foods are unsafe , while just 13 % say they are safe to eat . Australia is the only place surveyed where at least as many view GM foods as safe as view them to be unsafe ( 31 % to 31 % ) .
People in emerging markets are even more dubious of trade 's impact on prices – a median of just 18 % in these countries say it drives prices lower . But publics across the nine emerging markets surveyed are enthusiastic about trade 's other economic benefits : A median of 56 % think trade leads to more jobs and 47 % say it improves wages .
Despite Russians ' lukewarm view of the economy , a majority ( 55 % ) still approves of Putin 's handling of the issue . Putin also has the support of more than half the country when it comes to energy policy and civil society . The only area included in the survey in which he fails to earn majority approval is the issue of corruption .
Meanwhile , the percentage of Americans who say that reducing the budget deficit should be a top priority for the president and Congress rose 19 points between 2009 and 2013 , but has fallen eight points over the past two years . Pew Research Center surveys have found that , historically , the party holding the White House tends to place less importance on reducing the deficit compared with the party out of power . That remains the case today , with 72 % of Republicans and 55 % of Democrats rating deficit reduction as a top policy priority . But the share of Republicans who say that reducing the deficit should be a top priority has fallen 12 points ( from 84 % ) since 2013 . Among Democrats , deficit reduction declined from 67 % in 2013 to 49 % in 2014 , before recovering slightly this year .
Overall , Millennials ( currently ages 18 - 33 ) are the most liberal age group . In our report on Political Polarization in the American Public , we used a scale based on 10 political values questions about the role of government , the environment , homosexuality and other issues to measure ideological consistency . This survey of more than 10,000 Americans finds that , on this scale , Millennials are considerably more liberal than other generations : About four-in-ten Millennials are mostly ( 28 % ) or consistently ( 13 % ) liberal in their views , compared with 15 % who are mostly ( 12 % ) or consistently ( 3 % ) conservative ( 44 % are ideologically mixed ) . Older generations are progressively more conservative .
China has emerged as a global economic superpower in recent decades . It is not only the world 's second largest economy and the largest exporter by value , but it has also been investing in overseas infrastructure and development at a rapid clip as part of its Belt and Road Initiative . A new Pew Research Center survey finds that , particularly in emerging markets , publics largely have a positive view of China 's economic stature . People generally see China 's growing economy as a good thing for their country and believe China is having a predominantly positive influence on their country 's economic affairs . But , even while China 's rise is largely perceived as positive in emerging economies , there are pockets of discontent . First , even in the nations that welcome China 's economic growth , few feel similarly about its growing military might . Rather , most tend to view China 's growing military as something bad for their own countries . Second , China 's neighbors generally take a much more negative stance toward China 's military and economic growth than other countries surveyed . For example , in the Asia-Pacific region , more tend to see investment from China as a potential liability , giving Beijing too much influence over their economies . These same countries are also more likely than others to see U.S. economic influence in their country positively . And , when it comes to developed countries , views of China are much more mixed to negative . Generally , countries with stronger human rights records and lower levels of corruption tend to be much less keen on China .
About seven-in-ten Republicans ( 71 % ) approve of the tax law , including 43 % who strongly approve . Early last year , about the same share of Republicans approved of the tax law ( 75 % ) , but a majority ( 57 % ) strongly approved .
About a quarter ( 26 % ) say they followed news about the economy more closely than other major stories . News about the economy accounted for 12 % of the newshole measured by PEJ . That does not include 4 % of coverage devoted to the debate over whether to extend expiring Bush-era tax cuts . The tax debate was the most closely followed story for 7 % ; about two-in-ten ( 21 % ) say they followed this story very closely . While 11 % say they followed news about the elections most closely , the same percentage say they followed news about the release of a jailed American hiker held in Iran that closely . Nearly a quarter ( 23 % ) say they followed election news very closely , while 16 % say they followed news about the released hiker that closely . Her release accounted for 2 % of coverage . Another 4 % say they followed news about Israeli-Palestinian peace talks most closely , while 13 % say they followed this news very closely . The talks accounted for 1 % of coverage . And 4 % say they most closely followed the visit by Pope Benedict to Great Britain and his comments on the Catholic Church 's sex-abuse scandal ; 10 % say they followed this news very closely . The pope 's visit accounted for 2 % of coverage .
In an April survey , two-thirds of U.S. adults said the coronavirus outbreak is likely to significantly disrupt Americans ' ability to vote in November . Around a quarter of adults ( 23 % ) said a significant disruption is very likely , while another 44 % said it is somewhat likely . Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents were 30 percentage points more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners ( 80 % vs. 50 % ) to say it is at least somewhat likely that COVID-19 will significantly disrupt the election . ( The survey was conducted relatively early into the U.S. coronavirus outbreak , before cases and deaths spiked across much of the country . It 's possible attitudes may have changed since then . )
In the same vein , the new poll finds favorable ratings of the Democratic Party have declined sharply since spring . Just 49 % now say they have a favorable view of the Democratic Party . This compares with a 59 % favorable rating for the party as recently as April and 62 % shortly before Obama took office in January . Opinion of the Republican Party , which stands at 40 % , has not changed all year .
These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index , an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press . The index , building on the Center 's longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories , examines news interest as it relates to the news media 's agenda . The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism 's News Coverage Index , which monitors the news reported by major newspaper , television , radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis . In the most recent week , data relating to news coverage were collected from October 6 - 12 and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected October 10 - 13 from a nationally representative sample of 1,006 adults . Overall , nearly two-thirds of Americans ( 63 % ) list either economic conditions or the stock market drop as the single news story they followed more closely than any other last week . One-in-four ( 24 % ) list the campaign as their most closely followed story . For its part , the national news media divided its focus between the economy and the campaign last week . According to Pew 's Project for Excellence in Journalism , 41 % of the national newshole last week was devoted to the presidential campaign , while 36 % was devoted to the current financial crisis .
Asked which of six pressing issues should be the most important priority for their country , a median of 38 % across the nations polled name health care , including more than four-in-ten in Burkina Faso , Senegal , Tanzania and Uganda . In eight of nine countries , improving health care is the number one priority .
Nearly six-in-ten Republicans ( 58 % ) now say there are plenty of jobs available in their local communities , compared with 47 % of Democrats . Since the question was last asked in June 2016 , GOP views have become considerably more positive ( from 41 % who said plenty of jobs were available then to 58 % who say this today ) . Democratic views are little changed over this period ( 45 % then , 47 % today ) . The partisan gap is even more pronounced on the question of whether `` good jobs '' are available ( half of respondents are asked about `` job '' availability , half are asked about `` good jobs '' availability ) . While 57 % of Republicans say there are plenty of `` good jobs '' ( little different than the share who say there are plenty of jobs ) , just 32 % of Democrats say this .
Despite public skepticism about scientists working in both areas , most Americans think scientists should have a major role in policy decisions . About two-thirds ( 67 % ) of Americans say climate scientists should have a major role in decision making about climate matters . Six-in-ten Americans ( 60 % ) think scientists should have a major role in policy decisions related to GM foods . Scientists are not the only group Americans support at the policymaking table : At least half of U.S. adults think the general public should have a major role in policy decisions on climate change ( 56 % ) and GM foods ( 57 % ) .
About six-in-ten Mexicans ( 61 % ) say they would not move to the U.S. even if they had the means and opportunity to do so . However , a sizable minority ( 35 % ) say they would move to the U.S. if they could , including 20 % who say they would emigrate without authorization .
When thinking about why people move abroad , Indians say it is to advance careers and pursue educational opportunities . Roughly three-quarters think finding better jobs and furthering education are important reasons why people in India move to other countries . Roughly half see uniting with family living in another country as an important reason why Indians relocate abroad , while only about a quarter think Indians move to escape violence .
White evangelical Protestants express strong support for Republican candidates , just as they have in recent elections . Two-thirds of registered voters who are white evangelical Protestants in the new survey say they would vote Republican ( 67 % ) , compared to 22 % who would vote for a Democrat .
The distinction between being willing to compromise and actually giving way on specific issues is most stark when it comes to abortion . Nearly three-in-four ( 72 % ) say that the political party that most closely shares their view on abortion should stick to its position on this issue without compromising . Just a quarter say that the party should compromise so that some agreement can be reached . Even among those who think most highly of politicians who are willing to compromise , just 30 % want compromise on this issue , while more than two-thirds ( 68 % ) are unwilling to bend . There is considerably more support for compromise on other major issues of the day . A 54 % majority is willing to see leaders who share their views on the environment come to a compromise in order to reach some agreement , though even here , 43 % are not . Even among those who most admire willingness to compromise in political leaders , 39 % see no room for compromise on this issue .
An estimated 1.3 million Hispanics of Guatemalan origin resided in the United States in 2013 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Census Bureau 's American Community Survey . Guatemalans are the sixth-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States , accounting for 2.4 % of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2013 . Since 1990 , the Guatemalan-origin population has increased almost fivefold , growing from 267,000 to 1.3 million over the period . At the same time , the foreign-born population of Guatemalan origin living in the U.S. grew almost 300 % , up from 213,000 in 1990 to 834,000 in 2013 . In comparison , Mexicans , the nation 's largest Hispanic origin group , constituted 34.6 million , or 64.1 % , of the Hispanic population in 2013 .
By comparison , 26 % of whites , 29 % of Hispanics and 33 % of Asians say the legacy of slavery affects the position of black people in American society a great deal , though majorities in each group say it does so at least a fair amount . This year marked the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slave ship in Jamestown , Virginia .
Overwhelming majorities say gender equality is important . Across all surveyed countries , around nine-in-ten adults or more say it is very or somewhat important that women have the same rights as men . Women are more likely than men , however , to view gender equality as very important in most countries .
As attitudes toward the NRA have warmed , attitudes toward more restrictive gun control have cooled . In September 1990 , 78 % of respondents in a national survey told Gallup they felt that laws governing the sale of firearms should be stricter . The figure declined throughout the 1990s and reached its lowest point ( 51 % ) in October 2002 . Since then support for stricter controls on guns has hovered in the mid-50s , reaching a peak of 60 % in 2004 . Most recently , in October 2006 , 56 % of people told Gallup they favored stricter gun-sales laws . However , when given the choice in that poll between enforcing current gun laws more strictly or doing that plus passing new gun laws , most people ( 53 % ) preferred only that current laws be enforced more strictly .
Meanwhile , Americans continue to track news about the still-struggling economy closely . A quarter say this was the story they followed more closely than any other last week . Another 19 % say they followed the continuing financial troubles of U.S. automakers General Motors and Chrysler most closely . The media also maintained their focus on the economy . According to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism , reporting on the economic crisis accounted for 13 % of the newshole last week . That made it the leading story , though coverage of the horrific shooting at the U.S . Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington was not far behind ( 11 % ) .
There are strong generational differences on climate change , energy issues and other topics . On climate change , 31 % of those ages 65 and older say the Earth is warming due to human activity , compared with 60 % of those ages 18 - 29 . And when asked which should be a more important priority – alternative energy sources , such as wind or solar , or expanding production of oil , coal and natural gas – 48 % of those 65 and older favor alternative energy , compared with 74 % of those under the age of 30 . Older adults also express greater support for offshore drilling and nuclear power .
Today , the Republicans lead on a number of key engagement indicators , though in some cases by smaller margins than four years ago . Currently , 45 % of registered voters who plan to support the Republican in their district say they are more enthusiastic about voting than in prior congressional elections ; that compares with 37 % of those who plan to vote for the Democratic candidate . The GOP had a 13-point enthusiasm advantage at this point in the midterm campaign four years ago ( 55 % to 42 % ) and the Democrats held a 17-point advantage eight years ago ( 47 % to 30 % ) .
There continue to be wide partisan and ideological differences in opinions about the Supreme Court 's ideological leanings . A majority of liberal Democrats ( 56 % ) say the court is conservative ; just 12 % of conservative Republicans say the same . Nearly half of conservative Republicans ( 48 % ) see the court as liberal , compared with 8 % of liberal Democrats . About four-in-ten conservative Republicans ( 38 % ) and 31 % of liberal Democrats say the court is middle of the road .
Catalonia 's independence referendum has been controversial , but the Spanish public is quite positive on direct democracy in general . Three-quarters believe that a system where citizens , not elected officials , vote directly on major national issues to decide what becomes law would be a good way to govern their country . People living outside of Catalonia are in agreement with their Catalan counterparts on this issue ( 74 % versus 79 % , respectively ) .
Seventeen years into the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan , Americans remain pessimistic about U.S. efforts in the country . About half of adults ( 49 % ) say the United States has mostly failed in achieving its goals there , while about a third ( 35 % ) say it has mostly succeeded , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . Another 16 % say they do not know if the U.S. has succeeded or failed . Republicans are now more optimistic than Democrats that the U.S. mission in Afghanistan has succeeded in achieving its goals , according to the new survey , conducted Sept. 18 - 24 among 1,754 adults . About half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents ( 48 % ) say the U.S. has succeeded , compared with about three-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaning independents ( 28 % ) .
Overall , the world resettled 103,000 refugees in 2017 , down from 189,000 in 2016 . The broad-based decline included decreases in other leading countries in refugee resettlement , such as Canada and Australia , though the drops in these countries were more modest than those in the U.S . The decline in refugee resettlement comes as the global refugee population increased by 2.75 million , and reached a record 19.9 million in 2017 , according to UNHCR . This exceeds the high in 1990 , following the fall of the Berlin Wall .
Still , most parents with children younger than 18 say it would be best for them personally to be employed , either full time or part time , at this point in their life . Among fathers , 82 % say it would be best for them to be working full time ; 11 % say it would be best to be working part time and just 7 % say it would be best to not be working for pay at all . Views are more varied among mothers : 51 % say it would be best for them to be working full time , 30 % say part-time work would be best and 19 % say the optimal arrangement for them would be not to work for pay at all right now . Mothers across income groups express similar views of what would be best for them at this point in their life . About half of part-time working moms ( 54 % ) say working part time is best for them at this point in their life , but a sizable share ( 33 % ) say working full time would be best and 14 % say not working for pay at all would be best . And among stay-at-home moms , 39 % say not working for pay at all is what 's best for them , but a similar share ( 35 % ) say it would be best for them to be working part time ; a quarter of mothers who are not employed say it would be best for them to be working full time .
For American Muslims , being highly religious does not necessarily translate into acceptance of traditional notions of Islam . While many U.S. Muslims say they attend mosque and pray regularly , sizable shares also say that there is more than one way to interpret their religion and that traditional understandings of Islam need to be reinterpreted to address the issues of today . At the same time , American Muslims openly acknowledge that there is room for multiple interpretations of the teachings of Islam . A majority ( 64 % ) say there is more than one true way to interpret the faith 's teachings , while just half as many ( 31 % ) say there is only one true way to interpret Islam . And it 's not just less-religious Muslims who express this sentiment : While 72 % of Muslims who say religion is somewhat ( or less ) important in their life say they are open to multiple interpretations , a majority ( 59 % ) of those who say religion is very important in their life also say there is more than one true way to interpret the faith . Among U.S. Christians , there is a similar balance : 60 % say there is more than one true way to interpret the teachings of their religion , while 34 % say there is just one true way . About half ( 52 % ) of all U.S. Muslim adults also say that traditional understandings of Islam must be reinterpreted to reflect contemporary issues , while 38 % maintain that traditional understandings of Islam are all that are needed to address today 's issues . On this question there is more of a difference of opinion among Muslims when it comes to how important religion is in their lives . Those who say religion is very important in their lives are evenly divided ( 43 % say traditional understandings should be reinterpreted vs. 46 % who say traditional understandings are all that is needed ) , while about seven-in-ten ( 71 % ) of those who say religion is less important express the view that Islamic teachings need to be reinterpreted .
The chart compares the federal minimum to the poverty thresholds for five different household types . ( We used the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers , Research Series , to adjust the wage levels . ) For example , in 1968 , when the minimum wage was at its peak value , one minimum-wage job could keep three people out of poverty . Today 's minimum , which works out to $ 15,080 a year ( assuming a full 40-hour work week ) , will lift a single person out of poverty . However , it 's nearly $ 1,000 below the poverty threshold for a one-adult , one-child household .
Just 18 % of registered voters check the description `` someone you admire '' for Clinton and even fewer ( 10 % ) indicate that this description applies to Trump . Few voters also associate the word `` honest '' with either Trump ( 19 % ) or Clinton ( 13 % ) . This also is the case for the phrase `` can unite the country '' – 19 % indicate that this describes Trump , while 17 % check it for Clinton . Clinton is viewed more positively – and less negatively – than Trump in several dimensions . About a third ( 36 % ) checks `` well-informed '' for Clinton , compared with 13 % who do so for Trump . And while 36 % associate the phrase `` willing to work with people they disagree with '' to Clinton , just 20 % indicate that it applies to Trump .
Among those who were familiar enough with each to rate them , Bernanke 's favorable rating stood at 54 % in March 2008 , before the financial crisis peaked in the fall of that year . Republicans and Republican leaners expressed far more favorable opinions of Bernanke ( 71 % ) than did Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 45 % ) . In September 2013 , toward the end of his tenure , partisan views of Bernanke had shifted : 69 % of Democrats viewed him favorably , compared with 43 % of Republicans .
Among Republicans , in particular , there are sizable income differences in expectations for the law 's personal impact . A majority ( 62 % ) of Republicans and Republican leaners with incomes of $ 75,000 or more say the tax law will have a mostly positive impact on them and their families . That compares with 50 % of Republicans with incomes between $ 40,000 and $ 74,999 and 43 % of those with incomes below $ 40,000 . Majorities of Republicans across income categories say the law will have a mostly positive impact on the country in coming years .
Across Latin America , the portion of people who identify as Catholic has declined considerably in recent decades , from at least 90 % in the 1960s to 69 % in 2014 . This decline is largely due to widespread conversion to Protestant ( and especially evangelical ) denominations , as well as some people leaving organized religion altogether . But the trend away from Catholicism has been less pronounced in Mexico , where 81 % of adults identify as Catholic today , compared with 90 % who say they were raised Catholic , according to a 2014 Pew Research Center report . The decline in the percentage of Mexicans who identify as Catholic pales in comparison with some of Mexico 's neighbors in Central America , where in some cases the share of adult Catholics has fallen by more than twice the rate found in Mexico . Half of adults or fewer in Guatemala , Nicaragua , El Salvador and Honduras now identify as Catholic , while roughly four-in-ten in each country say they are Protestant . In Mexico , about one-in-ten adults were raised Catholic but no longer identify with Catholicism . By contrast , in Nicaragua , roughly a quarter of adults have left Catholicism after having been raised in the faith .
Overall , Americans generally feel their doctors and health care providers will keep their personal records safe from hackers or unauthorized users , with about eight-in-ten Americans expressing confidence that they will do so . A majority feels the same way about public health organizations , though four-in-ten say they are not at all or not too confident that these organizations will keep their records safe . And roughly half of U.S. adults ( 49 % ) are at least somewhat confident in the ability of the federal government to keep their records safe .
But , the majority of Americans do n't believe entertainment media undermine their understanding of science , technology and medicine . About half of frequent viewers of crime-focused shows ( 51 % ) say these programs have no effect on their own understanding of science-related topics . More say these shows help than hurt their understanding by a margin of 40 % to 9 % .
Among all smartphone app users , six-in-ten downloaders have chosen not to install an app when they discovered how much personal information the app required in order to use it . Separately , 43 % have uninstalled an app for the same reason after initially downloading it .
During much of Barack Obama 's presidency , Millennials have been some of his strongest supporters , rating his job performance much more positively than those in older generations . And today — with Obama 's overall approval rating at 51 % , the highest in nearly three years – the generation gap in approval is among the widest since he took office in 2009 . About six-in-ten ( 62 % ) Millennials ( adults born after 1980 ) approve of the job Obama is doing . By comparison , half of Generation Xers ( born 1965 - 1980 ) , 43 % of Boomers ( born 1946 - 1964 ) and just 37 % of Silents ( born 1928 - 1945 ) offer positive ratings of the president 's job performance .
About six-in-ten ( 59 % ) Americans say they are hearing a mix of good and bad economic news , largely unchanged from the 62 % that said the same in early November . One third ( 33 % ) say they are hearing mostly bad news and 7 % say they are hearing mostly good news .
Despite concerns about politicians and about the current state of democracy more generally , most Czechs ( 80 % ) approved of the change from a one-party to a multiparty system that took place in the early 1990s . Elsewhere in the region , support for the political changes was also strong ; majorities in all of the former Eastern European publics surveyed except Ukraine embraced the move to competitive politics . But , only the east Germans ( 85 % ) edged Czechs out in support of the move to a competitive election system .
A number of long-standing trends in presidential elections either reversed or stalled in 2016 , as black voter turnout decreased , white turnout increased and the nonwhite share of the U.S. electorate remained flat since the 2012 election . Here are some key takeaways from the Census Bureau 's report , the data source with the most comprehensive demographic and statistical portrait of U.S. voters . The black voter turnout rate declined for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election , falling to 59.6 % in 2016 after reaching a record-high 66.6 % in 2012 . The 7-percentage-point decline from the previous presidential election is the largest on record for blacks . ( It 's also the largest percentage-point decline among any racial or ethnic group since white voter turnout dropped from 70.2 % in 1992 to 60.7 % in 1996 . ) The number of black voters also declined , falling by about 765,000 to 16.4 million in 2016 , representing a sharp reversal from 2012 . With Barack Obama on the ballot that year , the black voter turnout rate surpassed that of whites for the first time . Among whites , the 65.3 % turnout rate in 2016 represented a slight increase from 64.1 % in 2012 . The Latino voter turnout rate held steady at 47.6 % in 2016 , compared with 48.0 % in 2012 . Overall turnout remained flat despite expectations heading into Election Day of a long-awaited , historic surge in Latino voters . Due largely to demographic growth , the number of Latino voters grew to a record 12.7 million in 2016 , up from 11.2 million in 2012 . Even so , the number of Latino nonvoters – those eligible to vote who do not cast a ballot , or 14 million in 2016 – was larger than the number of Latino voters , a trend that extends back to each presidential election since 1996 . Meanwhile , the Asian voter turnout rate increased to 49.3 % in 2016 , up from 46.9 % in 2012 and surpassing Hispanics for the first time since 1996 . Asians continue to represent a smaller share of voters than Hispanics : Overall , about 5 million Asians voted in 2016 , up from 3.8 million in 2012 . The number of naturalized-citizen voters reached 10.8 million in 2016 , up from 9.3 million in 2012 . In a year when immigration played a central role in the presidential campaign , turnout among naturalized-citizen voters ( those who were immigrants born in another country who have naturalized to become U.S. citizens ) was 54.3 % , up from 53.6 % in 2012 . Overall , the voter turnout rate among foreign-born citizens trailed that of U.S.-born voters , who had a 62.1 % turnout rate in 2016 . But among Asians and Hispanics – the nation 's two largest immigrant groups – the pattern was reversed . In 2016 , turnout among Asian naturalized citizens was 51.9 % , compared with 44.9 % for U.S.-born Asians . Among Hispanics , naturalized-citizen turnout was 53.4 % , higher than the 45.5 % turnout for U.S.-born Hispanics .
You posit that there may be more of this going on among Millennials than among older respondents . It 's an interesting observation , but we have no way of knowing from our data whether it 's true . On the general topic of racial tolerance and diversity , however , there are a few things we do know . First , all age groups in this country have grown more tolerant over time , and Millennials are the most tolerant of all , as illustrated by the accompanying chart on attitudes about interracial dating . Might there be some social desirability embedded in these responses ? Sure . But even if that 's all we 're measuring , it may be its own marker of social progress . Lip service , after all , is one of the tributes we pay to virtue .
Nearly six-in-ten adults ( 59 % ) say that the actions of ordinary Americans have a great deal of impact on how the coronavirus spreads through the country , while 28 % say that individual actions affect the spread of the virus a fair amount ; about one-in-ten ( 12 % ) say that the actions of ordinary Americans affect the spread of the virus either not too much ( 10 % ) or not at all ( 2 % ) . Nearly three-quarters of Democrats ( 73 % ) say that the actions of ordinary Americans affect how the coronavirus spreads in the U.S. a great deal and 22 % say the actions of ordinary Americans have a fair amount of effect . Just 5 % of Democrats say that individual actions affect how the virus spreads either not too much or not at all . While most Republicans say that individual actions affect the spread of the coronavirus , fewer than half ( 44 % ) say that this affects the spread of the virus a great deal . About one-third ( 35 % ) say that individual actions affect how the virus spreads a fair amount , and roughly two-in-ten Republicans ( 21 % ) say that individual actions affect how the coronavirus spreads either not too much or not at all . There are also notable age and educational differences in beliefs about the impact of individual actions . About half ( 52 % ) of adults ages 18 to 29 say that the actions of ordinary people affect the spread of the virus a great deal , compared with more than six-in-ten ( 63 % ) of those 65 and older . And those with a postgraduate degree are 20 percentage points more likely to say this than adults without any college experience .
Three of the top four newsmakers of the week , not including Obama , were tied to the president-elect . The speculation about whether Hillary Clinton would be named secretary of state made her the lead newsmaker in 3 % of the stories for the week . Eric Holder , Obama 's pick for attorney general , was 2nd at 2 % . Joe Lieberman , who faced retribution for supporting McCain but ultimately got to keep his committee chairmanship in the Senate , was 4th . ( Obama , who dominated all others , was the top newsmaker in 8 % of all the stories last week ) .
Among those who oppose the flag 's removal , by far the most common reason people cite is that the flag is an important part of history and a symbol of heritage and pride : 54 % describe their feelings in these terms . About a quarter ( 27 % ) of those who say the decision to take the flag down was wrong say that the flag is misunderstood or does not represent racism and slavery . A smaller share ( 17 % ) mention that the flag itself is harmless and removing it was unnecessary , while 15 % view the decision as an overreaction to the Charleston event and 12 % express concern that the decision to take down the flag represents government overreach or impinges on freedom of speech and expression .
Barack Obama 's job approval rating has shown little change from last month . In the current survey , 49 % disapprove of how he is handling his job and 43 % approve . Obama 's ratings had steadily declined from May to November of last year , before he regained some ground in December .
1 40 % of internet users have personally experienced online harassment . We defined online harassment as having had at least one of six incidents personally occur to someone : name-calling , efforts to be purposefully embarrassed , physical threats , harassment over a sustained period of time , sexual harassment , and stalking . ( Respondents were separately asked if they had witnessed any of these behaviors occur to others online ; 73 % said they had ) . Online harassment fell into two distinct , but frequently overlapping , categories of severity – `` less severe '' harassment was composed of name-calling and embarrassment ; 22 % of internet users exclusively experienced this kind of harassment . Another 18 % of internet users experienced any of the `` more severe '' types of harassment , including physical threats , sustained harassment , stalking , and sexual harassment .
Millennial workers , those ages 18 to 35 , are just as likely to stick with their employers as their older counterparts in Generation X were when they were young adults , according to recently released government data . And among the college-educated , Millennials have longer track records with their employers than Generation X workers did in 2000 when they were the same age as today 's Millennials . In January 2016 , 63.4 % of employed Millennials , the generation born between 1981 and 1998 , reported that they had worked for their current employer at least 13 months . In February 2000 , somewhat fewer 18- to 35-year-olds ( 59.9 % ) – most of whom are today 's Gen Xers – reported similar job tenure . Looking at young workers with longer tenures , 22 % of Millennial workers had been with their employer for at least five years as of 2016 , similar to the share of Gen X workers ( 21.8 % ) in 2000 .
The share of U.S. children living with an unmarried parent has more than doubled since 1968 , jumping from 13 % to 32 % in 2017 . That trend has been accompanied by a drop in the share of children living with two married parents , down from 85 % in 1968 to 65 % . Some 3 % of children are not living with any parents , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data . Most children in unmarried parent households are living with a solo mother , but a growing share are living with cohabiting parents . Overall , about one-in-five children ( 21 % ) are living with a solo mother , up from 12 % in 1968 . Some 7 % are living with cohabiting parents , about double the share that were doing so in 1997 ( the first year for which census data on cohabitation are available ) . The share of children living with a solo father has ticked up , and stands at 4 % , up from 1 % in 1968 . ( In this analysis , children are classified based on the parent with whom they live most of the time . Children who split their time equally between households are classified based on which household they were in at the time of the data collection . )
And as May elections for the European Parliament approach , attitudes toward the EU-wide legislative body are mixed , although overall ratings are slightly more favorable ( a median of 50 % ) than unfavorable ( 45 % ) . The UK and Greece once again stand out for their negative assessments , while Germans and the French are almost evenly divided .
Even though the unemployment rate has fallen sharply since the 2010 midterm elections and a host of other economic measures have improved significantly , it has not done much to brighten the public 's mood on what it considers to be the most important voting issue . While the economy gets better marks than in the last two elections , that is n't saying much . Just 21 % of Americans rated the economy as excellent or good in a mid-October survey ( compared with 13 % in September 2012 and 8 % in October 2010 ) . And , in this election cycle , fewer Americans expect continued improvement with just 27 % believing economic conditions will be better a year from now .
Voters are increasingly taking an active role in the political process by contributing their own thoughts or comments to the online debate . In 2008 , nearly one in five internet users posted their thoughts , comments or questions about the campaign on a website , blog , social networking site or other online forum .
A growing share of Americans now use smartphones as their primary means of online access at home . Today roughly one-in-five American adults are `` smartphone-only '' internet users – meaning they own a smartphone , but do not have traditional home broadband service .
Some 44 % of all Hispanic adults — and fully half of all first-generation Hispanic immigrants — say that today 's children in this country will grow up to be better off than people are now , according to a recent Pew Research Center survey . By contrast , just 33 % of both whites and black hold this positive view .
Outside of China , Europe was home to some of the first major coronavirus hotspots – as well as some of the most stringent early national quarantine requirements to curb the spread . Results of a summer survey – conducted before a second surge in cases began , in earnest , in September – indicate that people in most European Union nations approved not only of their national governments ' response to COVID-19 , but also of how the EU had handled the outbreak . Across the eight EU member nations surveyed between June and August 2020 , a median of 61 % said the EU had done a good job dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic . Approval was highest in Germany and the Netherlands , where 68 % in each country applauded the bloc 's efforts . At least half or more in every EU country surveyed approved of the EU 's response .
The share of multiples born in the U.S. is at an all-time high , according to recently released data from the National Center for Health Statistics . In 2014 , 3.5 % of all babies born were twins , triplets or higher-order multiples , accounting for almost 140,000 births . While multiples still make up a small share of all births , this marks a dramatic increase since 1915 – the first year for which reliable data are available – when about 2 % of all births were multiples . In fact , the share of multiples remained quite constant for decades until the 1980s , when it started to tick up .
The accompanying chart shows the percent that support allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally across generations from 2005 to 2015 . Over this time period , support for same-sex marriage has grown from 36 % to 55 % among the public overall . ( See this interactive for opinions of same-sex marriage over time . ) Millennials and Gen Xers came into the population more supportive of allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally than older generations , and those greater levels of support have persisted over time . As a result , some of the explanation for an overall shift in attitudes about same-sex marriage is attributable to a `` generational replacement '' as members of older , less supportive , generations pass away , they are `` replaced '' in the adult population by members of younger , more supportive , generations entering adulthood .
Obama 's travel itinerary will take him to three European countries where he is extremely popular : France , Germany and Britain . In France , 84 % of those following the U.S. presidential race say they have confidence in Obama to do the right thing in world affairs ; only a third , however , are confident in McCain . The numbers are almost identical in Germany ( 82 % confidence in Obama , 33 % in McCain ) . The gap between the two candidates is slightly less pronounced in Britain , although it is still a staggering 30 percentage points — 74 % have confidence in Obama , 44 % in McCain . Obama also receives higher marks than McCain in the other two European Union countries included on the survey , Spain and Poland .
Although early withdrawals from retirement accounts increased during the Great Recession and its aftermath , the difference was less than what one might have expected — largely , researchers from the Federal Reserve and the IRS found , because early withdrawals were so substantial in the years leading up to the recession . The data suggest that many families were under financial stress even during the apparently prosperous years of the mid-2000s .
The number of people ages 5 and older who speak Arabic at home has grown by 29 % between 2010 and 2014 to 1.1 million , making it the seventh most commonly spoken non-English language in the U.S . Meanwhile , the number who speak Spanish at home has grown only 6 % over the same time period .
The Millennial generation also encompasses a broad span of adults ( currently those born from 1981 to 1997 ) . But just 40 % of those in this cohort consider themselves Millennials , while as many as a third ( 33 % ) say they belong to Gen X . Among older Millennials ( ages 27 to 34 ) , 43 % consider themselves Gen Xers , while 35 % identify as Millennials . Yet even among younger Millennials ( ages 18 to 26 ) , fewer than half ( 45 % ) consider themselves part of this generation . Most adults ( 58 % ) born between 1965 and 1980 , the birth years of Gen X , identify with `` their '' generation . Notably , relatively few Gen Xers ( just 4 % ) identify as Millennials , but 15 % consider themselves Boomers . Among younger Gen Xers ( ages 35 t0 42 ) , 68 % identify with Gen X ; among older Gen Xers , fewer ( 48 % ) see themselves as part of this generation , while 24 % identify as Boomers .
But Americans have a very different view of the news sources they rely on than they do of the news media generally . When asked to rate the accuracy of stories from the sources where they get most of their news , the percentage saying these outlets get the facts straight more than doubles . Fully 62 % say their main news sources get the facts straight , while just 30 % say stories are often inaccurate .
Support for maintaining Roe v. Wade is somewhat higher than broader measures of public support for legal abortion , but the overall patterns of opinion are similar . In October , 59 % of the public said abortion should be legal in all or most cases , compared with 37 % who said abortion should be illegal in all or most cases . While a steady majority has said abortion should be legal in recent years , support in October was as high as it had been in two decades . Still , as with views of Roe v. Wade , the partisan gap in support for legal abortion has grown wider in recent years . While 79 % of Democrats say abortion should be legal in all or most cases , just 34 % of Republicans say the same .
Public evaluations of news organizations ' performance on key measures such as accuracy , fairness and independence remain mired near all-time lows . But there is a bright spot among these otherwise gloomy ratings : broad majorities continue to say the press acts as a watchdog by preventing political leaders from doing things that should not be done , a view that is as widely held today as at any point over the past three decades . In the wake of revelations about government activities , including the NSA surveillance program and the IRS targeting of political groups , nearly seven-in-ten ( 68 % ) say press criticism of political leaders keeps them from doing things that should not be done , while just 21 % say press criticism keeps leaders from doing their job . Support for the media 's watchdog role has risen 10 points since 2011 even as other press ratings have shown little sign of improvement .
This tilt to the Twitter conversation was evident throughout the fall campaign . In nearly every week from early September through the first week of November , the Twitter conversation about Romney was substantially more negative than the conversation about Obama . Still , the overall negativity on Twitter over the course of the campaign stood out . For both candidates , negative comments exceeded positive comments by a wide margin throughout the fall campaign season . But from September through November , Romney was consistently the target of more negative reactions than was Obama .
Researchers Ronald J.O . Flores and Arun Peter Lobo call it integration without blacks . In the past 40 years they found nearly a three-fold increase in the share of integrated New York City neighborhoods with a mix of whites , Hispanics and Asians but few , if any , blacks .
Most Americans have heard about the U.S. government 's surveillance programs , and some have changed their behavior because of it . Fully 87 % are aware of the federal surveillance programs ; among those aware of the programs , 25 % – and 22 % of adults overall – say they have changed the way they use technology at least somewhat after the Snowden revelations , according to our November 2014-January 2015 survey . Additionally , 61 % of those aware of the programs say they have become less confident that the programs are serving the public interest .
By and large , the public views these examples of algorithmic decision-making as unfair to the people the computer-based systems are evaluating . Most notably , only around one-third of Americans think that the video job interview and personal finance score algorithms would be fair to job applicants and consumers . When asked directly whether they think the use of these algorithms is acceptable , a majority of the public says that they are not acceptable . Two-thirds of Americans ( 68 % ) find the personal finance score algorithm unacceptable , and 67 % say the computer-aided video job analysis algorithm is unacceptable .
In addition to measuring the broad impact and meaning of social media , since 2012 the Center has also tracked the specific sites and platforms that users turn to in the course of living their social lives online . In that context , a national survey of 1,520 adults conducted March 7-April 4 , 2016 , finds that Facebook continues to be America 's most popular social networking platform by a substantial margin : Nearly eight-in-ten online Americans1 ( 79 % ) now use Facebook , more than double the share that uses Twitter ( 24 % ) , Pinterest ( 31 % ) , Instagram ( 32 % ) or LinkedIn ( 29 % ) . On a total population basis ( accounting for Americans who do not use the internet at all ) , that means that 68 % of all U.S. adults are Facebook users , while 28 % use Instagram , 26 % use Pinterest , 25 % use LinkedIn and 21 % use Twitter . Thanks in part to the growing number of older adults who are joining the site , Facebook use appears to be on the rise : The share of online adults who report using Facebook has increased by 7 percentage points compared with a Pew Research Center survey conducted at a similar point in 2015 . In addition , the share of Facebook users who check in daily has increased slightly in the past year : 76 % of Americans who use Facebook now report that they visit the site on a daily basis , up from 70 % in 2015 . Roughly eight-in-ten online Americans ( 79 % ) now use Facebook , a 7-percentage-point increase from a survey conducted at a similar point in 2015 .
In September 2008 , far more voters ( 72 % ) said they were satisfied with the presidential choices that year . More voters also were satisfied with the candidates in the 2004 ( 66 % ) , 2000 ( 64 % ) and 1996 ( 61 % ) campaigns .
Along with failure to erase doubts about the future , economic confidence today is dogged by the popular belief that times were better before the Great Recession . Substantial shares in 15 of the 27 nations polled believe that , compared with 20 years ago , the financial situation of average people in their country is worse today . This view is especially pronounced in Greece ( 87 % ) , Tunisia ( 75 % ) , Italy ( 72 % ) , Spain ( 62 % ) , France ( 56 % ) and the UK ( 53 % ) . But public perceptions of a more prosperous past often do not mirror real economic change . In Brazil , where a plurality of 43 % say personal financial conditions are worse today than 20 years ago , adjusted per capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) calculated on a purchasing power parity ( PPP ) basis is actually up 26 % since 1998 . In Mexico , while 40 % say times are worse for average people , per capita GDP is 16 % higher . The same is the case in Spain and France , where a majority of the public believes personal finances have deteriorated , but per capita real GDP has improved 25 % and 11 % respectively .
Nearly two-thirds ( 65 % ) of Mexicans surveyed after the law 's enactment had heard about it , and the image of the U.S. in Mexico took a nosedive , according to a 2010 Pew Research Center survey . Prior to enactment of the law , 62 % of Mexicans had a favorable view of their northern neighbor while only 27 % held a negative one . After the measure became law , 48 % of Mexicans registered a negative view of the U.S. while 44 % expressed a positive one . The survey did not specifically ask if the law was the reason for the change in opinions . But positive views of the U.S. have bounced back since then . In a survey this spring , 66 % of Mexicans said they viewed the U.S. favorably compared to 30 % who did not . That represented a gain of 22 percentage points among Mexicans surveyed after the law 's passage in2010 .
Views of climate change have been consistently partisan over the past decade . Now , Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are more than twice as likely to say climate change is a major threat than Republicans and Republican-leaning independents ( 88 % vs. 31 % ) . The share of Democrats who believe climate change is a threat has risen from 61 % in 2009 , while Republican views on this issue have remained relatively steady .
About a third ( 36 % ) followed news about the debate in Washington over federal spending very closely last week and 14 % followed this most closely . Media coverage far surpassed interest in these stories , accounting for 31 % of the newshole . Public interest in addressing the nation 's finances declined from the previous week , when 47 % very closely followed the threat of a government shutdown because of budget disagreements . The 2012 presidential election is attracting only modest interest in this early stage of the race . Two-in-ten ( 20 % ) are following very closely and just 4 % said news about potential 2012 candidates was their most closely followed story . Campaign news interest is now on par with interest at this point in the 2008 presidential race . In April 2007 , 18 % said they were following election news very closely .
The survey finds that 52 % of Americans now view the nation 's highest court favorably , while 38 % have an unfavorable opinion . Ratings of the court have edged lower since April ( from 56 % favorable ) . The court 's favorability decline since April has been driven by a shift in views among Democrats . Roughly half of Democrats ( 52 % ) view the Supreme Court favorably , down from 63 % in April . There has been little movement in favorability ratings among Republicans or independents .
Two years ago , according to Vital Statistics , 38 representatives either retired or ran for some other office instead of their House seat . Since 1930 , the year with the highest House turnover was 1992 , the year the House banking and post office scandals broke . 65 representatives retired or ran for something else that year ; while that might have counted as an `` exodus , '' this year 's departures do not .
Fully 83 % of AAAS scientists report that obtaining federal research funding is harder today than it was five years ago . More than four-in-ten say the same about industry funding ( 45 % ) and private foundation funding ( 45 % ) compared with five years ago . Further , when asked to consider each of seven potential issues as a `` serious problem for conducting high quality research today , '' fully 88 % of AAAS scientists say that a lack of funding for basic research is a serious problem , substantially more than any of the other issues considered .
In addition , a growing share of the public expresses concerns that the government 's anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to adequately protect the country ( 50 % ) rather than going too far in restricting the average person 's civil liberties ( 35 % ) . This is a shift from when this question was asked last year after revelations about the NSA 's domestic surveillance program . Pluralities then said they were more concerned that the government had gone too far ( 47 % in July and 44 % in November ) . Today , the balance of opinion is similar to the public 's views in late 2010 .
In Latin America , where nearly 40 % of the world 's Catholics live , Protestant populations have risen sharply . In a survey conducted in the region in 2014 , 9 % of respondents across 19 Latin American countries said they were raised as Protestants , while 19 % identified Protestant ( or evangelical ) Christianity as their current religion . Net gains for Protestants in Latin America have meant net losses for Catholics . While 84 % of respondents were raised as Catholic , only 69 % identified their current religion as Catholic . Protestants across Latin America also are significantly more religious than Catholics . And they are more likely to take conservative positions on issues such as divorce , abortion , gay marriage and gender norms . One relatively recent and distinctive Protestant movement that has gained ground globally is Pentecostalism . While practices vary , Pentecostal churches often emphasize the `` gifts of the Holy Spirit , '' such as divine healing , speaking in tongues and receiving direct revelations from God . These practices are common among Protestants in sub-Saharan Africa , Latin America and even in Asia . For example , in a survey conducted in 2014 , the majority of churchgoing Protestants across 19 Latin American countries said they have at least occasionally witnessed speaking in tongues , prophesying and praying for a miraculous healing in church .
With the election of Donald Trump , positive views of the U.S. and confidence in the U.S. president plummeted . As of 2018 , only one-in-ten Germans had confidence in Trump and three-in-ten held a favorable view of the U.S. , levels of antipathy not seen since the end of the George W. Bush administration . Supporters of the right-leaning anti-immigration party AfD are more favorable toward the U.S. than those who do not support AfD ( 43 % vs. 26 % , respectively ) , and they are also more likely to express confidence in President Trump . People who look favorably on other German parties tested are more in line with the general population on U.S. image and confidence in Trump .
While news about the 2008 presidential campaign remained the public 's top story for a second week in a row , the conditions of the U.S. economy continued to attract considerable public interest . For the last two weeks , a third of the public ( 34 % ) has listed the economy as their most closely followed news story . Greater than six-in-ten Americans ( 63 % ) were following the economy very closely last week and another 27 % were following economic news fairly closely . According to Pew 's PEJ , news coverage of the economy accounted for 13 % of the newshole , down somewhat from the previous week when it was 22 % of total news . The murder of actress Jennifer Hudson 's mother , brother and nephew attracted the very close attention of 17 % of the public . Fewer than one-in-ten ( 7 % ) listed news about the Hudsons as their most closely followed story of the week . As is often the case with tabloid stories , women were more interested in the story than men . Two-in-ten ( 22 % ) women followed this story very closely compared with 11 % of men . The national media devoted 2 % of all news to the Hudson family tragedy .
Americans are also less accepting of implanted devices that would result in more dramatic rather than modest changes in the recipient . For example , the public is closely divided over whether an implanted device that improves a person 's mental functioning to a level equal to their current peak abilities would be appropriate or taking technology too far . By a ratio of more than two-to-one , people are much more likely to say that implanting devices that dramatically increase a person 's peak abilities would be taking technology too far .
About four-in-ten Americans say they either own a gun themselves or live in a household with guns , and 48 % say they grew up in a household with guns , according to a new Pew Research Center study . At least two-thirds of adults say they 've lived in a household with a gun at some point in their lives . And roughly seven-in-ten – including 55 % of those who have never personally owned a gun – say they have fired a gun at some point .
Liberal Democrats ( who constitute about a third of all Democratic voters ) have distinctly different preferences for the party 's presidential nomination when compared with those who are very liberal . Nearly identical shares of liberal Democrats name Biden ( 25 % ) , Warren ( 23 % ) and Sanders ( 22 % ) as their first choice for the nomination . Among very liberal Democratic voters , Sanders ( 38 % ) and Warren ( 30 % ) outpace the other candidates . Biden receives only about half as much support from very liberal Democrats ( 12 % ) as he does from liberals ( 25 % ) . The preferences of conservative and moderate Democrats are less divided . Biden holds a substantial advantage : 30 % of moderate and conservative Democrats favor Biden , while 15 % back Sanders and smaller shares favor other candidates .
A quarter of Latinos in the U.S. say there are too many immigrants living in the country , while about half ( 48 % ) say there are the right amount and 14 % say there are too few , according to the survey , conducted between July and September 2018 . These numbers represent a dramatic shift from 2002 – the first time the Center asked this question – when 49 % of Latinos said there were too many immigrants in the country , 37 % said there were the right amount and 8 % said there were too few .
The percentage of the public thinking the war was going very well was as high as 71 % on Friday and Saturday , only to fall to 52 % on Sunday and 38 % Monday as the public learned of American casualties and POW 's . Overall , the interviews by Sunday and Monday found about as many people thinking the war effort was going just fairly well ( 41 % ) as opposed to very well ( 45 % ) . Only 8 % went as far as to say the war effort was not going well .
Younger Americans continue to be more likely than older Americans to say they favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally : Fully 74 % of Millennials ( ages 18 to 36 ) say they favor same-sex marriage , while just 23 % say they are opposed . And by more than two-to-one , more Generation Xers ( those ages 37 to 52 ) favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry than oppose same-sex marriage ( 65 % vs. 29 % ) . Support for same-sex marriage among older adults also has increased over the past ten years . Today , a 56 % -majority of Boomers ( those ages 53 to 71 ) say they favor allowing legal same-sex marriage , while a smaller share ( 39 % ) say they are opposed . Support among Boomers has increased since March 2016 , when just less than half ( 46 % ) said they favored same-sex marriage . Among the Silent generation ( those ages 72 to 89 ) , 49 % oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry , while 41 % favor this . However , support for same-sex marriage has nearly doubled among members of the Silent generation since 2007 , when just 24 % said they were in favor .
As in past elections , nonvoters 1 – those who are either not registered to vote or are considered unlikely to vote in the upcoming midterms – are very different demographically from likely voters : They 're younger . Roughly a third ( 34 % ) of nonvoters are younger than 30 and most ( 70 % ) are under 50 ; among likely voters , just 10 % are younger than 30 and only 39 % are under 50 . They 're more racially and ethnically diverse . Fully 43 % of those who are not likely to cast ballots Tuesday are Hispanic , African American or other racial and ethnic minorities , roughly double the percentage among likely voters ( 22 % ) . They 're less affluent and less educated . Nearly half of nonvoters ( 46 % ) have family incomes less than $ 30,000 , compared with 19 % of likely voters . Most nonvoters ( 54 % ) have not attended college ; 72 % of likely voters have completed at least some college .
The Chinese have confidence that their country 's athletes will perform well at the games . Three-quarters say China , which finished third in the medal count , behind the United States and Russia , at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , will win the most medals this summer . Only 15 % think the U.S. will take home the most medals .
Despite the stagnant economy and broad dissatisfaction with national conditions , Barack Obama holds a significant lead over Mitt Romney . Currently , Obama is favored by a 50 % to 43 % margin among registered voters nationwide . Obama has led by at least a slim margin in every poll this year , and there is no clear trend in either candidate 's support since Romney wrapped up the GOP nomination .
Support for same-sex marriage has been on the rise over the past 15 years . Across four Pew Research Center surveys this year , 48 % of Americans say they favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally , while 43 % are opposed . Just four years ago , in the 2008 election cycle , 51 % opposed making same-sex marriages legal and 39 % supported it . While support has grown in all regions of the country , it is far stronger in some than in others . In New England , 62 % favor same-sex marriage , while 29 % oppose it . People in the South express greater opposition . A majority ( 56 % ) in the central Southern states such as Alabama , Kentucky , Louisiana , Oklahoma and Texas oppose same-sex marriage , while about a third ( 35 % ) favors it — amounting to a 27 percentage point difference compared with New England . Attitudes toward gay marriage in the South are comparable to where the country as a whole was a decade ago .
How has the internet changed society ? And what will its impact be in the future ? Our research on the evolution of digital life for 15 years has tracked skyrocketing adoption rates for broadband , mobile and social media , and studied how the internet has changed our political engagement , civic discussion , dating and social ties , as well as how we manage our health . Technology has transformed our lives around digital networks , as chronicled in research director Lee Rainie 's book , `` Networked , '' co-authored with professor Barry Wellman in 2012 . The project has also paid special attention to the online life of key groups ranging from teens to senior citizens and it has done research informing key policy debates , such as those swirling around privacy .
Even before ISIS 's battlefield victories and humanitarian atrocities began capturing international headlines last summer , we found growing worries about extremism in the Middle East . For instance , 62 % of Jordanians said they were concerned about Islamic extremism in their country in our spring 2014 poll , up from 54 % a year earlier . There were also increases in Lebanon , Tunisia , Egypt and Turkey .
Throughout Europe governments are wrestling with how far to go to respond to calls to lift the veil and ban the head scarf . While the issue in the Netherlands involves full-face veils or burqas , head scarves also have divided publics across the continent . A 2005 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey in the Netherlands found that 51 % of the Dutch public favored banning head scarves in public .1 In Germany , 54 % also supported a ban while in France an even larger majority — 78 % — did so . But in Great Britain , a solid majority ( 62 % ) thought the banning of scarves was a bad idea . Opinion was more evenly divided in Spain , where 43 % said the ban is a good idea and 48 % opposed it .
As the two largest Spanish-language television networks in the U.S. , Univision and Telemundo are key providers of news for Spanish speakers . Univision 's average audience – measured as the average number of TVs tuned to a program throughout a period of time – declined for all three national time slots studied : a 12 % decline for the evening news time slot ( 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. ) , to an average audience of about 1 million ; a 14 % decline in late night news ( 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. ) ; and an 11 % decline for the morning news time slot ( 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. ) . Telemundo 's audience , on the other hand , increased by 7 % in the evening news time slot , to an audience of about 700 , ooo , and remained roughly steady at just under 400,000 for late night news .
In the midst of an ongoing debate over the power of digital technology companies and the way they do business , sizable shares of Americans believe these companies privilege the views of certain groups over others . Some 43 % of Americans think major technology firms support the views of liberals over conservatives , while 33 % believe these companies support the views of men over women , a new Pew Research Center survey finds . In addition , 72 % of the public thinks it likely that social media platforms actively censor political views that those companies find objectionable . The belief that technology companies are politically biased and/or engaged in suppression of political speech is especially widespread among Republicans . Fully 85 % of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents think it likely that social media sites intentionally censor political viewpoints , with 54 % saying this is very likely . And a majority of Republicans ( 64 % ) think major technology companies as a whole support the views of liberals over conservatives .
Rather , most people ( 57 % ) were bothered by what they saw as the system 's basic unfairness – `` the feeling that some wealthy people get away with not paying their fair share . '' Only about half as many – 28 % – pointed to the tax system 's complexity .
Views of the U.S. president are closely linked with attitudes toward the U.S. itself . Generally speaking , those with more trust in the U.S. president to do what is right in foreign affairs tend to view the U.S. more positively . For example , the two countries with the most confidence in Trump – Israel and the Philippines – are also among the most favorable toward the country he leads . Conversely , in Turkey and Mexico , low confidence in the U.S. president aligns with less positive views of the U.S . However , in almost every country surveyed , views toward the U.S. surpass confidence in the U.S. president , sometimes by wide margins .
Americans who have heard of the House Freedom Caucus are more likely to have negative than positive views of it . Overall , 36 % of these adults view the group favorably and 48 % view it unfavorably , and opinions vary sharply by political affiliation . Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who have heard of the caucus , 59 % view it favorably and 25 % view it unfavorably . The reverse is true among Democrats and Democratic leaners : About two-thirds ( 66 % ) of those who have heard of the group view it unfavorably , while one-in-five ( 19 % ) view it favorably . Among conservative Republicans who have heard of the caucus , 67 % view it favorably ; among liberal Democrats who have heard of the group , 74 % view it unfavorably .
South Africans appear to recognize the competing economic influence of the two world powers – and to welcome ties with both countries . According to a new Pew Research Center poll , about seven-in-ten ( 72 % ) say the U.S. has a great deal or fair amount of influence on economic conditions in South Africa ; 71 % say the same about China . Among those who believe the U.S. and China have a significant economic impact on their country , majorities say both nations ' influence is a good thing for South Africa : 67 % for the U.S. and 58 % for China . Regardless , Obama is likely to receive a warm welcome on the visit . Roughly seven-in-ten ( 72 % ) hold a favorable view of the U.S. , a higher percentage than in either 2002 or 2008 . And a broad majority ( 74 % ) express confidence in Obama to do the right thing in world affairs , much higher than the 32 % in 2008 who trusted his predecessor , President George W. Bush .
In most countries polled , people express the greatest faith in their own national governments . A median of 78 % across the eight countries where the question was asked say they are at least somewhat confident that their national government will help solve major problems in the country .
A majority ( 54 % ) of U.S. adults say they have heard `` nothing at all '' about the `` alt-right '' movement and another 28 % have heard only `` a little '' about it , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . Just 17 % say they have heard `` a lot '' about the movement .
Nearly half ( 47 % ) of adults in their 40s and 50s have a parent age 65 or older and are either raising a young child or financially supporting a grown child ( age 18 or older ) . And about one-in-seven middle-aged adults ( 15 % ) is providing financial support to both an aging parent and a child . While the share of middle-aged adults living in the so-called sandwich generation has increased only marginally in recent years , the financial burdens associated with caring for multiple generations of family members are mounting . The increased pressure is coming primarily from grown children rather than aging parents . A Pew Research Center survey conducted Nov. 28-Dec. 5 2012 found roughly half ( 48 % ) of adults ages 40 to 59 have provided some financial support to at least one grown child in the past year , with 27 % providing the primary support . These shares are up significantly from 2005 .
The public sees threats to workers from multiple fronts . For example , most Americans say that increased outsourcing of jobs to other countries ( 80 % ) and more foreign-made products being sold in the U.S. ( 77 % ) hurt American workers . Workers see automation as less of a threat . Large majorities see increased use of the internet and other technology in the workplace ( 70 % ) and more U.S.-made products being sold abroad ( 68 % ) as helping American workers .
Incomes are rising in the U.S. , but the increase is not being felt equally by all Americans . Household income in the U.S. is at or near the highest level it has been in the last 50 years . At the same time , income inequality continues to grow , and the growth has been more pronounced among some racial and ethnic groups than among others . For example , the gap between Asians at the top and bottom of the income ladder nearly doubled between 1970 and 2016 . Over that period , Asians went from being one of the groups with the lowest income inequality to the highest . A separate analysis found that , among Hispanics , the median income of foreign-born workers – but not U.S.-born workers – had returned to its pre-Great Recession peak in 2017 .
The average age at which U.S. women first become mothers is 26.4 – comparable to the age at first birth among Latvian women but lower than in the 28 other nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) for which data were available . At the other end of the spectrum , South Korean women are the oldest when they first give birth ( 31.4 years , on average ) . On average , women in Greece , Luxembourg , Switzerland , Japan , Spain and Italy are also in their 30s when they become mothers . Not only are U.S. women becoming moms sooner than many of their OECD counterparts , they are also ending their childbearing years with larger families – 2.2 children , on average . Of the 21 other OECD nations with available data , 20 have lower lifetime fertility , the only exception being Iceland . There , women at the end of their childbearing years have had 2.3 children , on average . In contrast , lifetime fertility dips below 2.0 in 17 other nations , going as low as 1.5 in Germany , Italy , Spain and Japan . All told , the share of U.S. women at the end of their childbearing years who ever had a baby now stands at 86 % , while 14 % are childless . This is about the same as rates of childlessness among women in Norway , Slovenia , Sweden and France . In contrast , almost one-in-four German women ( 23 % ) end their childbearing years having never had a baby . Rates of childlessness reach 20 % or more in Finland , Spain and Italy , as well . At the other end of the spectrum , only 9 % of women at the end of their childbearing years in the Czech Republic have never given birth .
Two-thirds of Americans ( 67 % ) say everything possible should be done to make it easy for every citizen to vote , but Republicans – especially conservative Republicans – are less likely to hold this view , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . While Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents ( 84 % ) overwhelmingly say everything possible should be done to make it easy to vote , Republicans and GOP leaners are split : Nearly half ( 48 % ) say everything possible should be done to make it easy to vote , while 51 % say citizens should have to prove they want to vote by registering ahead of time . Only about a third of conservative Republicans ( 36 % ) favor doing everything possible to make it easy to vote , compared with a majority ( 65 % ) of moderate and liberal Republicans . ( A report earlier this year , based on 2017 data , found that conservatives constituted a majority – 68 % – of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters ; moderates and liberals made up about a third of GOP voters , or 31 % . ) Among Democrats , large majorities of both liberals ( 89 % ) and conservatives and moderates ( 80 % ) say everything possible should be done to make it easy to vote . ( In 2017 , 52 % of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters described their views as conservative or moderate , while 46 % identified as liberal . )
Our August survey revealed a wide gulf in how Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton supporters viewed the country . It found Donald Trump supporters overwhelmingly believed that life in America is worse than it was 50 years ago `` for people like them , '' while most Hillary Clinton supporters took the opposite view , saying life for people like them has gotten better over the past half-century . The candidates ' supporters also differed in their expectations for the nation 's future . Trump backers were broadly pessimistic , while Clinton supporters had mixed assessments .
The public 's attitudes toward gun control have shown only modest change in the wake of last week 's deadly shooting at an elementary school in Newtown , Connecticut . Currently , 49 % say it is more important to control gun ownership , while 42 % say it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns .
The 2008 presidential campaign began much earlier than usual , but public interest in the campaign is at most only modestly higher than in previous campaigns . While Democrats are following the campaign more closely than at the same stage in previous primary contests , Republicans are no more engaged than in the past , resulting in a sizable partisan gap in campaign interest .
Their positive take on the U.S. does not keep the Japanese from taking a pessimistic view of their long-time ally 's trajectory on the world stage . About six-in-ten ( 61 % ) say the United States plays a less important and powerful role as a world leader today compared with 10 years ago . Just 7 % believe the U.S. plays a more important role , while 29 % say Washington is as important as a decade ago . Such Japanese sentiment about a longtime ally is striking : Only 39 % of the Chinese see the U.S. as less important than before .
Millennials ' views of the national news media also have grown more negative . In 2010 , four-in-ten Millennials said the national news media was having a positive impact on the way things were going in the country , a far more positive view than among older generations ( just 27 % of Silents and Baby Boomers and 29 % of Generation Xers said this ) .
Compared with perceptions of current King Salman in 2017 , the crown prince is seen as less trustworthy in his approach to foreign affairs . In 2017 , Pew Research Center asked adults in four Middle Eastern and North African countries if they had confidence in King Salman , and in all four , evaluations of the king were significantly more positive than the opinions of his son , the prince , given in 2019 . Among Turks and Israelis , Crown Prince Mohammed is about as trusted as his uncle , the late King Abdullah , was in 2011 , while in Lebanon , King Abdullah was considerably more popular than both his nephew and half-brother , King Salman . Between 2017 and 2019 , events occurred that may have dampened support for Saudi leaders . Not least was the assassination of Khashoggi in Istanbul , which added to already fraught relations between Turkey and Saudi Arabia . The killing also drew broad international backlash , including protests against the crown prince 's state visit to Tunisia in 2018 , where confidence in Saudi leadership fell by 14 percentage points . The decline in Lebanon may be tied to the alleged kidnapping of now former Lebanese prime minister , Saad Hariri , in Saudi Arabia during a state visit in late 2017 .
The polling variability in 2004 falls close to that seen in 1984 and 1988 , when the average spread was 2.2 % and 2.3 % , respectively , and slightly above the election of 2000 ( at 1.7 % ) . The greatest variability in the polls was seen in 1992 , when Ross Perot 's on-again , off- again candidacy ­ and Bill Clinton 's rising support in the June-July time frame ­ resulted in average polling variability of 2.9 percentage points . By contrast , the 1996 campaign , when Clinton consistently held a large lead over challenger Bob Dole , saw the least variation from one poll to the other ( an average spread of 1.2 percentage points ) .
To understand these differences , this study combines people 's voting histories ( from a national voter file , recently updated to include vote history from the 2016 election ) with their attitudes about politics and civic engagement , based on a nationally representative survey conducted in the spring of last year . In the survey , conducted in March and April during the presidential primaries , just 27 % of drop-off voters said they were following the 2016 election very closely , compared with 49 % of consistent voters . And drop-off voters were less likely than consistent voters to say that it made a lot of difference to them which party controlled the government ; just 39 % of drop-off voters said it mattered a lot whether Democrats or Republicans controlled the government , compared with 52 % of consistent voters .
Westerners ' views of Muslims were more mixed . A median of 50 % across four Western European countries , the U.S. and Russia called Muslims violent and a median of 58 % called them `` fanatical , '' but fewer used negative words like greedy , immoral or selfish . A median of just 22 % of Westerners said Muslims are respectful of women , but far more said Muslims are honest ( median of 51 % ) and generous ( 41 % ) .
With less than two weeks before the midterm elections , the Republican Party holds significant leads on several major issues . Voters say the GOP could do a better job than the Democrats on the economy , and the Republicans hold double-digit advantages on both terrorism and the budget deficit .
While the issue of gun control remains divisive , there are clear areas of agreement when it comes to a number of gun policy proposals . Fully 85 % of Americans favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks , with comparable support from Republicans , Democrats and independents .
In much of Eastern Europe , there is now greater acceptance of post-communist political changes compared with Pulse of Europe surveys conducted by the then-Times Mirror Center for the People & the Press in 1991 , as the Soviet Union was collapsing . Even so , the legacy of communism is apparent in the attitudes of many Eastern European publics . Only about half of those in Ukraine and Russia approve of the political changes that have occurred since the collapse of the Soviet Union .
This includes 64 % of those surveyed in advanced economies and 59 % in emerging markets . Only in developing economies is there some semblance of satisfaction with economic performance : 51 % voice the view that their economy is doing well .
With the election still close to a year away , Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say they have given at least some thought to the candidates . Currently , 86 % of Republicans say they have given a lot or some thought to the presidential candidates , compared with 75 % of Democrats and 72 % of independents .
The public has long sympathized more with Israel than the Palestinians in the Middle East conflict and that continues to be the case . More than four times as many people say they sympathize with Israel rather than the Palestinians ( 49 % to 11 % ) ; 15 % say they sympathize with neither side , while a sizable proportion offers no opinion ( 20 % ) .
Americans by and large say that the United Kingdom is the preeminent foreign partner , with 27 % mentioning the UK as the most important foreign policy partner . A further 14 % of Americans name China and 10 % say Israel .
Adults under 30 were also less likely than people in older age groups to say it was very important to pay all the taxes you owe , serve on a jury if called and participate in the census every decade . Relatively few adults under 30 said it was very important to know the Pledge of Allegiance ( 38 % ) or display the American flag ( 19 % ) .
With regard to specific security policies , 50 % say the use of military drones to target extremists in Pakistan and other countries in the region has made the United States safer from terrorism , just 14 % say it has made the U.S. less safe , while 27 % say it has not made a difference . The government 's phone and internet surveillance programs get mixed grades : 39 % say they have made the nation safer from terrorism , 14 % less safe and 38 % say they have not made a difference . Finally , as the war in Afghanistan is winding down , just 31 % of the public say the 12-year-long conflict has made the country safer from terrorism , 21 % say it has made the U.S. less safe , and the plurality view ( 43 % ) is that it has not made a difference in U.S. security .
Likewise , most adults in Taiwan would welcome closer political ties with the United States . Nearly eight-in-ten overall support more Taipei-Washington political interactions , and at least seven-in-ten or more in each of the groups analyzed say they would favor more bilateral political relations . The highest level of enthusiasm for this comes from those who support the DPP ( 91 % ) , those who identify solely as Taiwanese ( 84 % ) and those ages 18 to 29 ( 82 % ) .
Latinos have become considerably more upbeat about their personal finances and optimistic about their financial future since the Great Recession , according to newly released results from a national survey of Latino adults . The survey also shows that Latinos have pulled even with the general U.S. population in their views of their personal finances and continue to outpace them on optimism about the future . However , community economic indicators show limited progress since the Great Recession . Four-in-ten Latinos say their personal finances are in `` excellent '' or `` good '' shape , a 17 percentage point increase since 2008 , when only 23 % made a similarly positive assessment of their finances ( the Great Recession began in December 2007 ) . 1 By contrast , the share of all Americans who have a similarly positive view of their finances remained essentially flat during the same seven-year period ( 41 % in 2008 vs. 43 % in 2015 ) . The survey also shows that Hispanics are more upbeat in their financial expectations for the upcoming year than they were in 2008 . About eight-in-ten Hispanic adults ( 81 % ) say they expect their family 's financial situation to improve in the next year , up from 67 % who said the same in 2008 . By comparison , the U.S. public is not as upbeat – 61 % say they expect their family 's financial situation to improve , up from 56 % who said this in 2008 .
The survey examined attitudes toward five world leaders , and overall Donald Trump receives the most negative ratings among the five . A median of 70 % across the 25 nations polled lack confidence in the American leader . Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping also receive mostly negative reviews . In contrast , opinions about German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are generally positive . Both leaders are mostly popular in the EU , although there are regional divides within Europe , with Merkel and Macron receiving favorable ratings in the Northern European nations surveyed and less stellar reviews in Eastern and Southern Europe .
Among the public overall , positive ratings for the government 's handling of ensuring access to health care have declined 20 percentage points since 2015 ; today , just 36 % say it does a very or somewhat good job in ensuring access to health care , down from 56 % two years ago .
No story captured the public 's attention last week nearly as much as the death of Trayvon Martin , which was the most closely followed story for the second straight week ( 30 % ) . That was followed by a trio of topics—Supreme Court hearings about the 2010 health care law , 2012 election news and the economy—that divided the public 's attention roughly equally . Overall , 15 % of the public followed the Supreme Court hearings about the 2010 health care law most closely . About three-in-ten ( 29 % ) say they followed this story very closely . The hearings accounted for 19 % of news coverage , according to a separate analysis by PEJ . The broader debate over health care , which includes the hearings , was PEJ 's top story of last week , making up 21 % of the newshole .
The California wildfires overshadowed all other news stories last week both in terms of public interest and news coverage . Four-in-ten Americans followed news about the fires very closely , making it the fourth most closely followed news story of the year . The only stories that have attracted a larger audience this year were rising gas prices in May , the Virginia Tech shootings in April , and the Minnesota bridge collapse in August . Nearly half of the public ( 46 % ) listed the California fires as the single news story they followed more closely than any other last week . Comprising 38 % of the national newshole , the wildfires became the second most heavily covered news story of 2007 . Only the Virginia Tech shootings surpassed the fires in terms of overall news coverage . The fires were covered more intensely on television news outlets than on other sectors — 53 % of network TV news and 51 % of cable news was devoted to the story .
Since Barack Obama 's administration , there have been declines in the shares in both parties who rate the economy and jobs as top priorities , with the changes somewhat more pronounced among Democrats . Today , 78 % of Republicans and 64 % of Democrats say strengthening the economy should be a top priority ; in 2013 , overwhelming majorities in both parties ( 87 % each ) said the economy was a top priority . That year , 81 % of Democrats and 76 % of Republicans also viewed improving the job situation as a top policy goal . Today , 66 % of Republicans and 58 % of Democrats say this .
The average audience for the evening newscasts for ABC , CBS and NBC remained relatively stable in 2018 , with 5.3 million viewers tuning in on average , compared with 5.2 million in 2017 , according to Comscore TV Essentials® data . ( Average audience is defined as the average number of TVs tuned to a program throughout a time period . )
As more Americans are going cash-free , a growing share of the public is comfortable being without physical currency . Today , 53 % of Americans say they try to make sure they always have cash on hand just in case they need it . That represents a 7-percentage-point decline from the 60 % who reported this in 2015 . Conversely , just under half ( 46 % ) of Americans `` do n't really worry much about whether they have cash with them , since there are lots of other ways to pay for things . '' That is an increase from 2015 , when 39 % reported this . Roughly four-in-ten who say they do not really worry about carrying cash ( 43 % ) say they do n't use cash for their typical weekly purchases , compared with 18 % of Americans who report that they try to ensure that they always have cash .
Indian adults certainly recognize that their personal economic well-being has benefited greatly from strong national economic performance : Indian economic growth has averaged 7.3 % per year since 2014 . Roughly two-thirds ( 65 % ) say the financial situation of average people in India is better today than it was 20 years ago . Only 15 % say things are worse .
Among states , the proportion of unauthorized workers varies widely : They constitute roughly 10 % or more of the labor force in Arizona , California and Nevada , but less than 2.5 % in most Midwest and Plains states . They are especially likely to hold low-skilled jobs and their share of some of those occupations has grown . In 2008 , 17 % of construction workers were undocumented , an increase from 10 % in 2003 . One in four farmworkers is an unauthorized immigrant .
Today , 83 % of Republicans and Republican leaners say defending the country from future terrorist attacks should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year . By contrast , only about half of Democrats ( 53 % ) say the same .
Despite the growth of internet news , it is clear that television news outlets , specifically cable news outlets , are central to people 's impressions of the news media . When asked what first comes to mind when they think of news organizations , 63 % volunteer the name of a cable news outlet , with CNN and Fox News by far the most prevalent in people 's minds . Only about a third ( 36 % ) name one of the broadcast networks . Fewer than one-in-five mention local news outlets and only 5 % mention a national newspaper such as the New York Times , Wall Street Journal or USA Today . Just 3 % name a website – either web-only or linked to a traditional news organization – when asked what comes to mind when they think of news organizations .
The vast majority of people across 15 countries in Western Europe and in the United States say they would be willing to accept Muslims as neighbors . Slightly lower shares on both sides of the Atlantic say they would be willing to accept a Muslim as a family member .
In 2014 , the public was divided over the role of the government in the health care system – 47 % said the government was responsible for making sure all Americans have health care coverage , while 50 % said it was not . The public subsequently grew more supportive of the government ensuring that all Americans had health care coverage . Since last fall , however , there has been a 7 percentage point drop ( from 60 % to 53 % ) in the share of Americans who say this . The share of Republicans and Republican leaners holding the view that ensuring health care coverage is the government 's responsibility has decreased by 9 points since September 2018 , from 29 % to 20 % . Democratic views have not changed significantly over the past year – in September 2018 , 85 % said making sure all Americans have health care coverage was the federal government 's responsibility ; 81 % say this today .
Far fewer know the specifics about the GOP 's victories . Fewer than half ( 46 % ) know that the Republicans will have a majority only in the House of Representatives when the new Congress convenes in January , while 38 % can identify John Boehner as the incoming House Speaker .
If friendship is viewed as a step that could lead to marriage , it is easy to see why most Israelis say they oppose intermarriage . The vast majority of Jews ( 98 % ) , Muslims ( 85 % ) , Christians ( 86 % ) and Druze ( 83 % ) say that all or most of their close friends belong to their own religious community . Perhaps in part because they make up small percentages of Israel 's population , Muslims , Christians and Druze are more likely than Jews to say at least some of their close friends are from another group .
Lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) people generally see less social acceptance of transgender Americans than for lesbians , gay men and bisexuals in the country , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2013 . Among all LGBT respondents , eight-in-ten say there is only a little ( 59 % ) or no ( 21 % ) social acceptance for transgender people in society , while far fewer say there is little to no acceptance for gay men ( 27 % ) , lesbians ( 14 % ) or bisexual women ( 21 % ) or men ( 46 % ) . The 2013 Pew Research Center survey also found that LGBT adults are less religious than the general public in the U.S. And large majorities of LGBT Americans say that certain religious institutions – particularly Islam ( 84 % ) , the Mormon church ( 83 % ) , the Catholic Church ( 79 % ) and evangelical churches ( 73 % ) – are unfriendly toward people like them . LGBT adults have more mixed views of the Jewish religion and mainline Protestant churches , with 47 % and 44 % of LGBT adults , respectively , describing those religions as unfriendly , one-in-ten describing each of them as friendly and the rest saying they are neutral .
The survey finds that majorities of Democrats generally say the gender , race or sexuality of the Democratic nominee would n't make a difference in their enthusiasm for the candidate . About two-thirds or more say having a woman nominee ( 64 % ) , a black nominee ( 75 % ) or a gay , lesbian or bisexual nominee ( 68 % ) would n't make a difference . Still , far more Democrats say they would be more enthusiastic ( 31 % ) than less enthusiastic ( 4 % ) if the party 's nominee were a woman . Larger shares also say they would be more enthusiastic than less enthusiastic if the nominee were black ( 21 % vs. 4 % ) , Hispanic ( 21 % vs. 6 % ) or Asian ( 16 % vs. 9 % ) .
The countries where people are most likely to say bribes are important are China ( with a 5.5 average rating on the 10-point scale ) , Jordan ( 5.0 ) and Russia ( 4.5 ) ; and those least likely to do so are Brazil ( 0.8 ) , El Salvador ( 1.4 ) and Colombia ( 1.5 ) . ( The U.S. is near the low end of the scale with a 2.5 rating . )
• Newsroom salaries fell in 2012 . Overall , television news salaries fell about 2 % , the same percentage they gained in 2011 . News writers and news assistants enjoyed the biggest gains—16 % and 13 % respectively—from 2011 . Top news managers lost ground . News directors ' salaries were down 2.3 % , assistant news directors ' salaries were down 6.7 % and executive producers ' dropped 9.1 % . Salaries of news and sports anchors remained the same .
Fully 65 % of African Americans say the police have gone too far in responding to the shooting 's aftermath . Whites are divided : 33 % say the police have gone too far , 32 % say the police response has been about right , while 35 % offer no response .
The nation 's population will rise to 438 million in 2050 , from 296 million in 2005 , and fully 82 % of the growth during this period will be due to immigrants arriving from 2005 to 2050 and their descendants . ( Figure 1 )
While there is a gap in views among Democrats by level of education , there are no such educational differences among Republicans . Democrats with a college degree take an overwhelmingly negative view of the new tariffs : 89 % of college-educated Democrats think they will be bad for the U.S . Among Democrats without a college degree , a somewhat smaller share ( 70 % ) takes this view .
Public views of allowing increased offshore oil and gas drilling shifted noticeably last year in response to the Gulf oil leak . Since last summer , they have shifted again . Currently , 57 % favor allowing more oil and gas drilling in U.S. waters , up 13 points since last June ( 44 % ) . Nonetheless , support for expanded offshore drilling remains lower than in February 2010 ( 63 % ) .
Even though most Western Europeans are not very religious , and those who live in countries with a church tax can opt out of paying it , support for the tradition remains strong in the region , according to a new Pew Research Center report , based on a 2017 survey of 15 countries . The study examines public attitudes toward church taxes by comparing the views of Western Europeans who say they pay such taxes with those who have opted out . Six of 15 surveyed Western European countries have a mandatory church tax for members of religious groups . They are Austria , Denmark , Finland , Germany , Sweden and Switzerland . While the rules for administering the tax or fee vary from country to country , each nation generally assesses a portion of the income ( or taxes paid ) of taxpayers who are members of the country 's larger churches . While most registered Christians – and , in some countries , members of other religious groups – must pay the tax , people have the option of avoiding the tax by deregistering from their church . The money collected usually pays for church expenses , including clergy salaries , maintaining buildings and funding church charities . Sizable majorities of adults in all six countries with a mandatory tax say they pay it . Eight-in-ten Danes and roughly three-quarters of Austrians ( 76 % ) and Swiss ( 74 % ) say they pay the tax . In each country , a small share of adults – ranging from 8 % in Switzerland to 20 % in Finland – say they used to pay the tax but no longer do so .
By contrast , both less affluent and less educated church shoppers are more likely to value the potential social connections , religious education and community service offered by a church . Roughly six-in-ten ( 62 % ) of those with a high school degree or less say that access to religious education for children played an important role in their choice of congregation , compared with about half ( 51 % ) of college-educated adults .
Those who say the government is responsible for making sure all Americans have health coverage are divided over how health insurance should be provided . While 27 % of adults support a single national government program , a similar share ( 24 % ) say universal health care should be provided through a mix of private insurance companies and government programs .
Despite these somewhat lukewarm assessments of their current political system , Japanese remain solidly supportive of democracy . Roughly three-quarters ( 77 % ) endorse representative democracy , while almost two-thirds ( 65 % ) say referenda on major policy issues would be good for Japan – something that has never happened in post-World War II Japan .
From the day the storm made landfall on October 29 through Wednesday the 31st , news , information , photos and video made up more than half of all the Twitter conversation , according to a study by the Pew Research Center .
