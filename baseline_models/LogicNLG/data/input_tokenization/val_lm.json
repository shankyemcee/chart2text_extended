The steady growth in women 's labor force representation slowed in the 1990s as women 's participation peaked . Labor force participation declined for both men and women between 2000 and 2015 , so the growth rates of the male and female labor force are now quite similar on average : 0.8 % per year for women between 2000 and 2010 , compared with 0.7 % for men . ( The labor force can grow in spite of falling labor force participation because the working-age population is increasing . ) Looking forward , the BLS projections assume labor force participation will continue to decline for both men and women at similar rates . The result is that both labor forces are expected to grow by 0.5 % or less per year ."]], "7996.csv": [["Black Americans are far less likely than whites to give police high marks for the way they do their jobs .

The fourth quarter of 2010 is the first period since the middle of 2008 that native-born workers have experienced positive jobs growth ( growth being measured as the change over the same quarter in the previous year ) . For foreign-born workers , the fourth quarter of 2010 marks the third successive period of jobs growth . Thus , the economic recovery now appears to be benefiting all workers , although the gains to native-born workers have been a bit later in coming . But the jobs recovery has been far from complete for either group of workers . From the beginning of the recession in the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2010 , native-born workers lost 6.1 million jobs , a drop of 4.9 % , and foreign-born workers lost 262,000 jobs , or a drop of 1.2 % . The unemployment rate for native-born workers is up from 4.6 % to 9.0 % and for immigrants it is up from 4.5 % to 9.9 % ."]], "8204.csv": [["Democrats have grown less positive about elected officials who compromise .

A principal factor affecting this pattern is that the occupations and industries in which the unauthorized work tend to be those where employers do not provide insurance . Although poverty levels for children are higher than those of adults , children are more likely to have health insurance than adults . This pattern undoubtedly reflects the availability of coverage through the State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) in recent years . Children of immigrants are less likely to be covered by health insurance than children of natives , reflecting their higher levels of poverty and the lack of insurance on the part of their parents .
