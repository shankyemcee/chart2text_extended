In 2012 , there were 12 states \u2013 including several that are battlegrounds this year \u2013 in which nontraditional voting methods accounted for more than half the total vote . In North Carolina , for instance , early and absentee voting yielded nearly 2.8 million of the state 's total 4.5 million votes . In Arizona , nearly two-thirds of the 2012 vote was cast absentee . In Florida , early and absentee balloting each accounted for well over a quarter of the total vote ; only 44 % of Florida 's voters cast their ballots in the traditional way . And in Oregon and Washington , elections already were conducted entirely by mail ( they 're being joined by Colorado starting this year ) . In the 1970s and ' 80s , states began experimenting with other types of nontraditional voting . Eliminating special residency requirements and the need for a specific excuse to vote absentee was a common first step : California , Oregon and Washington were among the first states to introduce `` no-excuse '' absentee voting .

Excellent Very good Good Fair Poor", "Asked to assess their students ' performance on nine specific writing skills , AP and NWP tended to rate their students `` good '' or `` fair '' as opposed to `` excellent '' or `` very good . '' Students were given the best ratings on their ability to `` effectively organize and structure writing assignments '' with 24 % of teachers describing their students as `` excellent '' or `` very good '' in this area . Students received similar ratings on their ability to `` understand and consider multiple viewpoints on a particular topic or issue . '' But ratings were less positive for synthesizing material into a cohesive piece of work , using appropriate tone and style , and constructing a strong argument . These AP and NWP teachers gave students the lowest ratings when it comes to `` navigating issues of fair use and copyright in composition '' and `` reading and digesting long or complicated texts . '' On both measures , more than two-thirds of these teachers rated students `` fair '' or `` poor . '' In addition to giving students low ratings on their understanding of fair use and copyright , a majority of AP and NWP teachers also say students are not performing well when it comes to `` appropriately citing and/or referencing content '' in their work . This is fairly common concern among the teachers in the study , who note how easy it is for students today to copy and paste others ' work into their own and how difficult it often is to determine the actual source of much of the content they find online .
