In early March , however , the public had similar views of the U.S. as much . Majorities of Americans deem the economy very little , with only about a third ( 23 % ) have a negative opinion of the economy . Public interest in the economy has become much since recent years .

Trust in other people is relatively high in 14 advanced economies surveyed by Pew Research Center this past summer . But while a median of 62 % of adults across these countries generally believe most people can be trusted , there are significant differences in these views by age , education and other factors , according to a new analysis of findings from the survey . Overall , personal trust is highest in Denmark , where 86 % say most people can generally be trusted . Majorities in 10 other countries agree , including about seven-in-ten or more in the Netherlands , Canada , Sweden , Australia and the UK .

In addition to the immigrants ' basic optimism , this positive valuation could derive from two factors : newcomers are often comparing U.S. schools to those in their native lands , and they have also had less opportunity to be disappointed by their experiences here . ( Hispanic school children have much lower high school completion rates than do whites or blacks . )

Obama 's travel itinerary will take him to three European countries where he is extremely popular : France , Germany and Britain . In France , 84 % of those following the U.S. presidential race say they have confidence in Obama to do the right thing in world affairs ; only a third , however , are confident in McCain . The numbers are almost identical in Germany ( 82 % confidence in Obama , 33 % in McCain ) .

In Mexico , 37 % say the government is winning the campaign against drug traffickers , while 29 % say it is losing ground . Fewer say the government is making progress this year than did so in 2012 ( 47 % ) .
At the same time , a third or more of Americans think that unethical behavior is treated relatively lightly – that is to say , wrongdoers face serious consequences only a little of the time or less often . Indeed , majorities believe that members of Congress ( 79 % ) , local elected officials ( 57 % ) , leaders of technology companies ( 55 % ) and journalists ( 54 % ) admit mistakes and take responsibility for them only a little of the time or none of the time .

About half of Americans ages 18 to 29 ( 49 % ) and those 50 and older ( 45 % ) say the government has more to do with the right amount of the coronavirus outbreak . Far more than half of Republicans ( 36 % ) say the government has more to do the right thing , while 38 % say it will be illegal .

When asked whether their country should or should not use military force to defend the N-word , about two-thirds of Americans ( 76 % ) say it would remain the right thing , while 36 % are opposed . In 2011 , a majority of Germans ( 55 % ) said they should be able to reduce the same and 66 % said they should be willing to closer . The survey was conducted after Trump signed a case into the U.S. – with a majority of Americans ( 55 % ) say that migrants make the country should not make the right , while roughly two-thirds ( 55 % ) said they should not want .
Republicans have long been more support than Democrats that the federal government 's role in the future . About seven-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 78 % ) say the economy will be better in a year .

The survey examined attitudes toward five world leaders , and overall Donald Trump receives the most negative ratings among the five . A median of 70 % across the 25 nations polled lack confidence in the American leader . Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping also receive mostly negative reviews . In contrast , opinions about German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are generally positive . Both leaders are mostly popular in the EU , although there are regional divides within Europe , with Merkel and Macron receiving favorable ratings in the Northern European nations surveyed and less stellar reviews in Eastern and Southern Europe .
Despite their quite secular economic power , the vast majority of the public ( 81 % ) is also feeling good about Merkel 's capacity to do the right thing on the world stage . However , demographic groups differ somewhat in their trust of the chancellor 's international leadership . Germans ages 50 and older have more confidence in Merkel than their younger counterparts and women are more likely to feel this way than men . Despite the chancellor 's center-right political orientation , those on the political left are actually 11 percentage points more likely than those on the right to say they have confidence in Merkel 's ability to deal with foreign affairs .
Over a median of nearly four-to-one , adults in this country say that American parents are placing too little ( 56 % ) rather than too much ( 15 % ) pressure on students , with the remaining quarter ( 24 % ) saying that parents are exerting the right amount of pressure . Parents and non-parents feel roughly the same way about this question , the survey finds . So do Republicans and Democrats , blacks and whites , older adults and younger adults , people with low incomes and those with high incomes , and people with college degrees and those with a just a high school education or less . The only demographic gap in attitudes about this question — and it 's not especially wide — comes on the gender front . More men ( 62 % ) than women ( 51 % ) say parents are n't being tough enough .
Congressional Democrats hold especially wide leads over Trump – of at least 20 percentage points – on their approaches to the environment , ethics in government , Medicare , health care and Social Security . The Democrats are preferred by smaller margins on foreign policy , immigration policy and gun policy .
As in the past , substantial majorities across the political spectrum are either angry or frustrated with the federal government . But anger at the government is far more widespread among conservative Republicans than other partisan groups . This marks a change from 2011 , when political independents ( 75 % angry ) were about as likely as conservative Republicans ( 32 % ) to express anger at the federal government . In the new survey , 41 % of conservative Republicans say they feel angry at the government , compared with 27 % of independents . Conservative Republicans are roughly twice as likely as liberal Democrats to say they are angry with government ( 41 % vs. 18 % ) . But in October 2006 , during the Bush administration , liberal Democrats expressed more anger at the government than any other group . At that time , in the share of liberal Democrats who say they are either very or somewhat concerned about the president ( 42 % vs. 31 % ) .

About half of Americans ( 49 % ) say this , as do 69 % of U.S. adults . Only about a quarter of Americans ( 35 % ) say the government should do much , compared with 43 % who say it will not . In contrast , only about half of Americans ( 49 % ) said the government should be worse , compared with just 32 % of those who think the same .
Some 68 % of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters say they would prefer to candidates running for Clinton 's campaign , while only 8 % of voters say they would definitely or probably .

Nearly half of Americans ( 47 % ) say it will be necessary for a woman to vote in the country legally , while 36 % say it will be necessary .

A majority of Republicans ( 64 % ) also say it will be more likely to support a person who will vote to do the right thing , compared with just 36 % of independents .
In the new survey , majorities across all educational groups now say that in the next 50 years robots and computers will probably or definitely do much of the work currently done by humans .

There is a similar pattern in views of agreement with Trump on issues among Republican subgroups . While majorities of Republicans across demographic and educational categories agree with Trump on many or nearly all ( or all ) issues , half or more of self-described conservatives ( 50 % ) and those 65 and older ( 54 % ) say they agree with Trump on all or nearly all issues . That is higher than the shares among other groups of Republicans . For example , among Republicans under age 30 , just 21 % say they agree with Trump on all or nearly all of the important issues facing the country .
There also are similar differences in views of how they live in their local area . Roughly half of Americans ( 47 % ) say they talk about the economy , compared with 44 % of Republicans .

U.S. deportations of immigrants reached a record high in 2013 . The Obama administration deported a record 438,421 unauthorized immigrants in fiscal year 2013 , continuing a streak of stepped up enforcement that has resulted in more than 2 million deportations since Obama took office , according to Department of Homeland Security data . Up to that point , the current administration deported about as many immigrants in five years as the George W. Bush administration deported in eight years . A survey conducted in February found the public evenly divided over whether the increase in deportations was a good or a bad thing .

Even in Turkey , where bin Laden is highly unpopular , as many as 31 % say that suicide attacks against Americans and other Westerners in Iraq are justifiable . Majorities in all four Muslim nations surveyed doubt the sincerity of the war on terrorism . Instead , most say it is an effort to control Mideast oil and to dominate the world .
At the same time , a third or more of Americans think that unethical behavior is treated relatively lightly – that is to say , wrongdoers face serious consequences only a little of the time or less often . Indeed , majorities believe that members of Congress ( 79 % ) , local elected officials ( 57 % ) , leaders of technology companies ( 55 % ) and journalists ( 54 % ) admit mistakes and take responsibility for them only a little of the time or none of the time .

In the fall before Barack Obama and George W. Bush took the oath of office , majorities also said it was too early to tell how successful their presidencies would be . But in both cases , those that did offer predictions were more likely to say each would be successful than unsuccessful . For example , in 2009 30 % said Obama would be successful while just 4 % predicted he would be unsuccessful ; 65 % said it was too early to tell .

News reports last week about the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas competed for public attention with stories about the U.S. financial crisis and the Obama presidential transition . Roughly three-in-ten ( 28 % ) paid very close attention to news about renewed fighting in the Gaza Strip , while 18 % say this was the single news story they followed most closely . Still , in a week in which the media devoted more space to Middle East coverage than any other story , Americans remained most focused on the continuing economic crisis . Public interest in the first days of the latest Middle East conflict is on par with other recent foreign news stories , but is lower than interest in the Israel-Hezbollah war in August 2006 : 40 % followed news of that conflict very closely . It is important to note that the current survey was already in the field when Israel launched its ground invasion on Jan. 3 , ratcheting up the intensity of the conflict and the media coverage . According to the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism , reports from the Middle East led all news coverage last week , accounting for 21 % of the newshole .1

Awareness is also low in Pakistan ( 17 % ) .
The COVID-19 economic downturn has made it harder for some Americans to pay their monthly bills .

For Hispanics , this was a considerably greater share than the 28 % who said they have trouble paying their bills in a typical month .
In the days before Barack Obama and George W. Bush took the oath of office , majorities also said it was too early to tell how successful their presidencies would be . But in both cases , those that did offer predictions were more likely to say each would be successful than unsuccessful . For example , in 2009 30 % said Obama would be successful while just 4 % predicted he would be unsuccessful ; 65 % said it was too early to tell .
Since 2000 , English-speaking Asian-Americans have shown consistently higher rates of internet usage compared to whites , blacks , and Hispanics . Fully 72 % of English-speaking Asian-Americans said they were internet users 15 years ago when Pew Research began to regularly measure internet access . Whites and Hispanics would not cross this threshold until 2006 , and blacks would reach this level in 2011 . In 2014 , fully 97 % of English-speaking Asian-Americans reported being internet users . Among different racial and ethnic groups , African-Americans have seen the greatest growth rate between 2000 and today , though they are still less likely than whites and English-speaking Asian-Americans to be internet users .

Yet in the past , substantial majorities across the political spectrum are either angry or frustrated with the federal government . But anger at the government is far more widespread among conservative Republicans than other partisan groups . This marks a change from 2011 , when political independents ( 30 % angry ) were about as likely as conservative Republicans ( 32 % ) to express anger at the federal government . In the new survey , 41 % of conservative Republicans say they feel angry at the government , compared with 27 % of independents . Conservative Republicans are roughly twice as likely as liberal Democrats to say they are angry with government ( 41 % vs. 18 % ) . But in October 2006 , during the Bush administration , liberal Democrats expressed more anger at the government than any other group . At that time , just prior to the 2006 midterm , the percentage of liberal Democrats who said they felt angry at the federal government ( 44 % ) mirrors the share of conservative Republicans who say that today ( 41 % ) .

Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents were 30 percentage points more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners ( 80 % vs. 50 % ) to say it is at least somewhat likely that COVID-19 will significantly disrupt the election . ( The survey was conducted relatively early into the U.S. coronavirus outbreak , before cases and deaths spiked across much of the country . It 's possible attitudes may have changed since then . )
Roughly four-in-ten adults ( 38 % ) say they are `` not too '' or `` not at all '' confident that they will have enough income and assets for their retirement , according to a 2012 survey .
