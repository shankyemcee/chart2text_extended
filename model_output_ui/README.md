# Model Output UI
- This folder contains the code for a website that displays the model outputs of 500 samples each for the test dataset in the Statista and Pew datasets

## How to Run
1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install the NPM package live-server: `npm install -g live-server`
3. `live-server .` (you only need to run this line after installing for the first time)

### Notes
- You can use other alternatives for hosting a local development server, but this is one of the simplest ways I've found
- A local development server is required to load the CSV files
