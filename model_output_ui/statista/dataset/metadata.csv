This was over 1.6 times the national average of 3.7 percent. The high rate of unemployment There are many reasons why the unemployment rate among minorities is different than the national average. When it comes to African Americans, a large part of this is due to historical events, such as slavery and the struggle for civil rights, as well as the number of black families living below the poverty level. Additionally, in 2017, for every 100,000 of the population, there were 2,336 black men in prison.

                        Fate of the most popular candidates in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primaries from 1972 to 2020
                    ",out/multi_col/data/6581.csv,out/multi_col/imgs/6581.png," In the build up to each US presidential election, primaries and caucuses are used by the major parties to nominate their candidate for the general election. A primary election is run by the state and local governments, whereas the caucuses are private events that are organized and administered by the respective parties. Primaries involve voters going to the ballot box to decide who their respective candidates will vote for in the respective national conventions. Most states conduct ""open primaries"" that are open to all eligible voters; while a few states conduct ""closed primaries"" that are only open to party members. In contrast to this, caucuses involve party members meeting at events where they then discuss who they will vote for, although this system is gradually being phased out, with ten states switching from caucuses to primaries in 2016. Iowa caucus Iowa is generally the first state to select their nominees, and this is done during the Iowa caucus, which has become one of the most important and focal events on the campaign trail. While the winner is not guaranteed the party's nomination, the event helps to establish who the frontrunners in each race are, and in the past, has seen many candidates drop out of the race following poor performances. In the past fifty years, the Iowa Democratic caucus has put forward nine (out of thirteen) candidates who would go on to contest the general election (although two of these primaries were uncontested), while the Iowa Republican caucus has put forward just six (out of twelve) candidates who would receive their party's nomination (with four of these being uncontested). In recent years, many have criticized the influence afforded to the Iowa caucuses, as they do not feel the state (which is ninety percent white) reflects the diversity or demographic makeup of the United States; whereas supporters of the caucuses argue that these events prevent candidates from ignoring voters in smaller and more rural areas in favor of those in larger metropolitan areas, and requires them to conduct politics on a more personal level. New Hampshire primary The New Hampshire Primary usually takes place one week after the Iowa caucuses, and is the second major event in the campaign. As in Iowa, this primary's significance comes from the vast amount of media coverage afforded to it on the campaign trail, and it is often seen as a second (and final) chance for those candidates who underperformed in Iowa. Historically, the New Hampshire primary has a success rate below fifty percent when predicting the Democratic nominee (or forty percent when uncontested races are not included), while it has correctly chosen the Republican nominee on all but two occasions. As this primary is open to all voters, it is seen as a much better indication than Iowa of who will perform well in the general election (especially among undecided voters), and has allowed candidates such as John McCain in 2008 and Bill Clinton in 1992 to stage surprising comebacks in their respective races.

                        Germany: Urbanization from 2009 to 2019
                    ",out/two_col/data/2054.csv,out/two_col/imgs/2054.png," This statistic shows the degree of urbanization in Germany from 2009 to 2019. Urbanization means the share of urban population in the total population of a country. In 2019, 77.38 percent of Germany's total population lived in urban areas and cities. Urbanization in Germany Currently, about three quarter of the German population live in urban areas and cities, which is more than in most nations around the world. Urbanization, as it can be seen in this graph, refers to the number of people living in an urban area and has nothing to do with the actual geographical size or footprint of an area or country. A country which is significantly bigger than Germany could have a similar degree of urbanization, just because not all areas in the country are inhabitable, for example. One example for this is Russia, where urbanization has reached comparable figures to Germany, even though its geographical size is significantly bigger. However, Germany’s level of urbanization does not make the list of the top 30 most urbanized nations in the world, where urbanization rates are higher than 83 percent. Also, while 25 percent of the population in Germany still lives in rural areas, rural livelihoods are not dependent on agriculture, as only 0.75 percent of GDP came from the agricultural sector in 2014. So while Germany's urbanization rate is growing, a significant percentage of the population is still living in rural areas. Furthermore, Germany has a number of shrinking cities which are located to the east and in older industrial regions around the country. Considering that population growth in Germany is on the decline, because of low fertility rates, and that a number of cities are shrinking, the urban population is likely shifting to bigger cities which have more economic opportunities than smaller ones.

Apple iPod sales - additional information Introduced to the consumer market in 2001, Apple revolutionized the music industry with its pocket-sized music player iPod. Since its release, the iPod has been one of the most dominant products within the digital music player market, with total aggregate unit sales of nearly 360 million. The market for portable music players, however, has been slowing down in recent years. Apple’s own sales figures essentially follow the existing overall trend, as iPods sales worldwide have been dropping since 2010. The company still experiences a consistent sales peak in the first quarter of the company’s own financial year. For Apple, the first quarter of their financial year is from early October to late December �?just around the holiday season. The increased capacity of smartphones to play and store music as a multi-functional device has been pinpointed by industry experts as the main reason for the decline of digital music devices sales. This explanation seems fitting when looking at Apple’s devices sales figures over the years. iPod sales have decreased as iPhone and iPad sales have increased in the last few years. Up until the third quarter of 2010, Apple still sold more iPods than iPhones. In the last quarter of 2014, iPod sales accounted for only about one percent of Apple's total revenue. The declining of iPod sales has not had a negative impact on the company. As the share of the company’s total revenue made from iPod sales has decreased, strong sales of the iPad and the iPhone have allowed the company to maintain a dominant position in many markets worldwide.

                        ",out/multi_col/data/5903.csv,out/multi_col/imgs/5903.png," In the past four centuries, the population of the United States has grown from a recorded 350 people around the Jamestown colony of Virginia in 1610, to an estimated 331 million people in 2020. The pre-colonization populations of the indigenous peoples of the Americas have proven difficult for historians to estimate, as their numbers decreased rapidly following the introduction of European diseases (namely smallpox, plague and influenza). Native Americans were also omitted from most censuses conducted before the twentieth century, therefore the actual population of what we now know as the United States would have been much higher than the official census data from before 1800, but it is unclear by how much. Population growth in the colonies throughout the eighteenth century has primarily been attributed to migration from the British Isles and the Transatlantic slave trade; however it is also difficult to assert the ethnic-makeup of the population in these years as accurate migration records were not kept until after the 1820s, at which point the importation of slaves had also been illegalized. Nineteenth century In the year 1800, it is estimated that the population across the present-day United States was around six million people, with the population in the 16 admitted states numbering at 5.3 million. Migration to the United States began to happen on a large scale in the mid-nineteenth century, with the first major waves coming from Ireland, Britain and Germany. In some aspects, this wave of mass migration balanced out the demographic impacts of the American Civil War, which was the deadliest war in U.S. history with approximately 620 thousand fatalities between 1861 and 1865. The civil war also resulted in the emancipation of around four million slaves across the south; many of whose ancestors would take part in the Great Northern Migration in the early 1900s, which saw around six million black Americans migrate away from the south in one of the largest demographic shifts in U.S. history. By the end of the nineteenth century, improvements in transport technology and increasing economic opportunities saw migration to the United States increase further, particularly from southern and Eastern Europe, and in the first decade of the 1900s the number of migrants to the U.S. exceeded one million people in some years. Twentieth and twenty-first century The U.S. population has grown steadily throughout the past 120 years, reaching one hundred million in the 1910s, two hundred million in the 1960s, and three hundred million in 2007. In the past century, the U.S. established itself as a global superpower, with the world's largest economy (by nominal GDP) and most powerful military. Involvement in foreign wars has resulted in over 620,000 further U.S. fatalities since the Civil War, and migration fell drastically during the World Wars and Great Depression; however the population continuously grew in these years as the total fertility rate remained above two births per woman, and life expectancy increased (except during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918). Since the Second World War, Latin America has replaced Europe as the most common point of origin for migrants, with Hispanic populations growing rapidly across the south and border states. Because of this, the proportion of non-Hispanic whites, which has been the most dominant ethnicity in the U.S. since records began, has dropped more rapidly in recent decades. Ethnic minorities also have a much higher birth rate than non-Hispanic whites, further contributing to this decline, and the share of non-Hispanic whites is expected to fall below fifty percent of the U.S. population by the mid-2000s. In 2020, the United States has the third-largest population in the world (after China and India), and the population is expected to reach four hundred million in the 2050s.
