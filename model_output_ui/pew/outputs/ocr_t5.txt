About a quarter of White adults (65%) say their house of worship should be open as usual, while just 6% of Hispanic adults say it should be open with modifications like before the outbreak.
We have been following changes in the political attitudes of people in Italy, Greece and Spain all the years. Recently, we have seen an increase in inflation in the eurozone (from 3.02% to 3.0%), in the eurozone and in the EU (from 3.0 to 2.1%). But it is not surprising that the Italian economy has been recovering at a much faster rate than in the EU.

On the other hand, those who say it is more important to protect gun rights are far more likely than those who say gun ownership is a issue. Among those who say it is important to control gun rights, 41% say that they would vote for a candidate who supports gun rights, compared with 31% who say that they would not vote. People who have contributed money to an organization where it takes policy on gun policy are almost twice as likely as those who say it is important to control gun rights to say they would not vote for a candidate who does not agree on other gun policy (12%).

The Big Five Texas metropolitan areas – home to hundreds of thousands of Hispanics – are named after the cities of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, by the Pew Hispanic Center. The number of Hispanics living in these top 10 metro areas varies widely by region. In 2010, the Los Angeles-Long Beach metropolitan area had 5.7 million Hispanic residents, the largest of any metro area, followed by New York-Northeastern New Jersey (4.2 million).
The new survey also finds that global publics are more skeptical of the future of U.S.-Russia relations. Large majorities in most countries across the region continue to say relations between their two countries will get worse over the next few years with Trump as president. In Europe, a median of 51% believe relations will stay about the same and 37% say things will get worse. In the Middle East, people are much more likely than others to say relations will stay about the same (32% vs. 15%).
How do social media users discover news? Facebook is an important source of website referrals for many news outlets, but the users who arrive via Facebook spend far less time and consume far fewer pages than those who arrive directly. The same is true of users arriving by search. Our analysis of comScore data found visitors who go to a news media website directly spend roughly three times as long as those who wind up there through search or Facebook, and they view roughly five times as many pages per month. This higher level of engagement from direct visitors is evident whether a site’s traffic is driven by search or social sharing
Higher education levels are also seen in the Hispanic community, based on measures of attainment by states. In 2011, among Hispanics ages 25 and older in the District of Columbia, 24.1% achieved a bachelor’s degree in Maryland, 21.2 percent in Florida and 19.9% in Hawaii. By comparison, the rate of attainment among all Hispanics was 11.8%.

If confirmed, Gorsuch, who currently serves on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Colorado, would join at least 69 others with prior experience as judges. Of these, at least 30 also came from U.S. appellate courts. And like the vast majority of Supreme Court justices – 105 so far – Gorsuch would bring private practice experience to the court. While less common, Gorsuch’s previous role as principal deputy to the associate attorney general puts him in line with at least 23 justices who served in the U.S. Department of Justice.

Americans’ expectations for the year ahead include an effective treatment or cure for COVID-19, as well as a vaccine to prevent the disease: 83% and 73% of U.S. adults, respectively, say these developments will definitely or probably occur. At the same time, 83% of adults expect another coronavirus outbreak within the year, and 69% expect the focus on the coronavirus to delay progress on other disease treatments.
Yet there is less progress seen on other health issues besides cancer. About half (48%) say the U.S. is making progress on cigarette smoking, while 45% say the same about obesity. Opinion on smoking has been divided since early 2007.
Currently, 53% of registered voters who support Clinton as a candidate say they feel they are more voting for Trump, while 44% say it is more a vote against Obama. In 2008, however, this share was much higher: 25% of Democratic voters supported Clinton for Obama, while 25% supported Trump for McCain.
Government restrictions include not only national laws and policies, but also actions by local governments and officials, which we find account for a sizeable portion of government restrictions in many regions. For example, in June 2011, we scored at least a bit higher than average in five regions of the world, including Egypt, the Middle East and North Africa, and Asia, where we found a total of 4.2 government restrictions. In addition, sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas – all of which have been hit hard by the Gulf oil spill – have also been halted by the violence and protests
The trend is mostly driven by a growing number of teen cell phone owners. In 2008, 64% of teen cell phone owners were ages 12 or younger, making them slightly more likely than the 43% of adults who owned them in 2004 and 2008, respectively. Among other factors, cell phone ownership among boys has increased more modestly, from 37% in 2004 to 43% in 2008 and 43% in 2008. For more on cell ownership by age, see the Pew Internet Project report “Getting Started with Teens,” released Feb. 14, 2008.
The U.S. has the lowest applied tariffs on nearly all imported products in the world, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of customs and customs data. In 2017, the U.S. paid an average of 2.8% on products containing petroleum, petroleum, chemicals and other additives, the lowest total on the market. But that’s not all bad, because American customs tariffs are so low.
Obama continued to overshadow John McCain, not only in terms of news coverage but also in public visibility. The Illinois senator was featured prominently in 82% of all campaign stories, more than double the number of stories mentioning McCain (40%).
Nuclear weapons and immigration policy: Currently, about two-thirds of Americans have little or no confidence in Donald Trump to do these things. In the August survey, majorities had little or no confidence in the U.S. president to negotiate favorable trade agreements with other countries (50%), make good appointments to the federal courts (46%), and make wise decisions about the use of nuclear weapons.
About four-in-ten Americans (42%) say they followed news about the gun debate very closely last week, while 37% say they followed news about the debate about guns very closely. In early January, shortly after Obama announced proposals for strengthening gun laws, 34% followed news about the gun debate very closely.
Adults who are younger are more likely to use social media (55%) than those ages 18-29 (59%). In recent years, however, those ages 50 and older have shown more interest. For example, in 2005, 5% of adults ages 18-29 used social media, compared with 12% of those ages 65 or older.
The presidential campaign once again dominated national news coverage last week, driven in large part by the lively Democratic debate in Philadelphia. Fully 46% of Americans paid very close attention to campaign news, and 36% listed this as the single news story they followed more closely than any other.
The share of smartphone owners who rely on their smartphone for going online has roughly doubled since 2013, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. But the share of those who say they have a smartphone but no broadband internet at home has not risen as sharply since 2013. This gap varies by income. For example, 4% of adults whose annual household income falls below $30,000 say they have a smartphone but no broadband internet at home, compared with 12% of those whose annual household income falls below $30,000.
There are sizable differences in these views across demographic groups, with younger adults more likely than older Americans to favor a path to legalization.
For the first time in Pew Research Center surveys, liberal Democrats are now more likely to say they sympathize more with the Palestinians (13%) than with Israel (78%). This is a shift from last year, when moderate and liberal Democrats were about as likely to say they sympathized more with Israel (52%) as moderate and liberal Democrats (60%).
The midterm turnout rate for Latinos, Asians and whites reached a record low last year, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.
Iran has a difficult history with many of its neighbors, and this has led to a decline in support in many countries since 2012. In five of the six countries surveyed, Muslim-majority opinions of Iran have been largely negative over the past decade. In Pakistan, the Palestinian territories, Jordan and Turkey, opinions have generally been more positive than negative. But in Jordan, Turkey and Jordan, favorable views of Iran have deteriorated in recent years, and are now about half that level as they were in 2009.
Views of labor unions have fluctuated modestly over the past two decades, but have become more positive than they were during the Great Recession.
The mobile news environment is especially dynamic when it comes to engaging with long-form content. Mobile news publishers consistently publish short, engaging and action-packed stories on cell phones. In this regard, we found that mobile news consumers are increasingly engaged with short-form content and have an engaging experience across a wide range of topics. An average of one-third of mobile visitors per article reads one or more of these short forms, and one or more of these articles gets more read per page. By comparison, mobile news publishers produce an average of one-page views per article, resulting in roughly two-sided interactions per page
The rise of online streaming services such as Netflix and HBO Go has dramatically altered the media habits of Americans, especially young adults.
Since 2004, a steady increase in the number of newly enrolled foreign students has led to a steady increase in the number of newly enrolled foreign students in the U.S.
An estimated 1.7 million Hispanics of Colombian origin resided in the United States in 2013, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.
While the public and the media have been divided over the latest economic news, the public and the media have very closely followed news about a possible compromise between the U.S. economy and the recall of key parts of the European economy.
While the digital divide between the rich and the poor has increased dramatically over the past two years, Indian adults are still very concerned about the possibility of exposure to false or incorrect information on their mobile phones. About half of Indian adults (52%) say they are at least somewhat concerned about exposure to false information on their phones, and an additional 32% are very concerned. Overall, 52% of Indian adults say that information about mobile phone misinformation is very or somewhat accurate, and 54% say that people should not be too concerned about this issue.
About one-in-ten (13%) say they followed the discussions in Washington over whether to raise the debt limit more closely than any other major story. About three-in-ten (29%) say they followed these developments very closely. In mid-June, 24% said they were following the debate over whether to raise the federal debt limit very closely.
In general, people across the country are generally negative about how the local government is reacting to the coronavirus outbreak, but they are more likely to see their state and local governments as doing the right thing. Around eight-in-ten U.S. adults say the people in their households are overreacting to the outbreak, 86% say their state and local governments are doing the right thing, and 74% say their own government is doing the right thing.
One of the most persistent gaps between blacks and whites involves their levels of confidence in police, according to an August survey. In surveys dating back to 1995, the share of blacks saying they have a great deal or some confidence in police officers in their communities has been consistently lower than that of whites, though the share saying they have a fair amount of confidence has shifted only slightly over this time period.
Meanwhile, more than three-quarters of Japanese (79%) say their country rely too much on military force to defeat terrorism. When asked which is the best way to defeat terrorism, using overwhelming force is best, with just 7% saying relying too much on military force creates hatred and terrorism leads to more terrorism.
Americans expect space tourism to become a reality in the next 50 years, but a minority of Americans say they would not routinely travel in space. Half of U.S. adults expect this to happen, while 42% say they would be unlikely to be in a spacecraft. By 2068, the same share of Americans said they would be reluctant to routinely travel in space by 2068. One-in-seven U.S. adults (22%) said they would be reluctant to take part in this type of activity. Space tourism will be a part of U.S. activities, while 4
Only about one-in-six Americans (16%) are following news about the candidates for president in 2020, and the same is true of the candidates for Congress. In fact, the public is paying far less attention to the election itself: 19% are following the election very closely, and 31% are following news about the candidates fairly closely.
The presidential campaign once again dominated the national news last week, driven in large part by the lively Democratic debate in Philadelphia. Public interest in the campaign was up somewhat from previous weeks with 39% of Americans paying very close attention to campaign news. More than a third of Americans (32%) listed the campaign as the single news story they were following more closely than any other, placing it on par with rising gas prices.
The number of Jews in Israel who say the building of settlements helps Israel’s security building has increased in recent years. Currently, 25% of Israeli Jews say the building of settlements helps Israel’s security, while another 27% say it makes no difference.
As Americans receive information about the Chinese government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, an overwhelming majority (84%) say they trust information from the Chinese government about the outbreak. Nearly two-thirds (64%) say China’s handling of the outbreak has been only fair or poor, while just 15% say it has been good.
By a wide margin, the public supports the ability of workers in a variety of legally protected sectors to unionize. Fully 82% of manufacturing workers and factory workers say they should not be able to unionize, while just 15% support the possibility of unionization. Public transportation is the least supportive of unionization: 74% of police and firefighters say these workers should be able to work in certain sectors. However, just 35% of fast-food workers support the ability of workers to unionize.
The data show that median home prices in the U.S. have been above average for the last five years, and have been consistently higher through the years. Average monthly home prices in 2004 were at or above $220,000, in the four years leading up to the survey. However, that is down only modestly from 2005, when median home prices averaged $75,000, or about 10% of the total.
The survey found that among the top reasons for rising gas prices, opinion is most commonly followed (31%): “no opinion has gone up lately,” followed by greed (31%) and speculation (12%). Another 14% name politics or unrest, while 10% cite other reasons.
However, the percentage of people who think China takes an interest like their own is much higher in Africa than in any other region. A 56% majority of Americans say China does not take an interest too much or not at all into account. In the other four countries surveyed, only 28% believe China does consider an interest of their own. The percentage saying China does not take an interest at all is similar in Germany (56%), Britain (58%) and France (50%).
On the ideological spectrum, Sanders’ views are more liberal than those of any other Democratic candidate. A large majority of white Democrats (83%) describe his views as liberal, including 71% of Democrats and Democratic leaners who say this. Among black Democrats, a similar share describes his views as liberal (47%) as conservative, but that share is higher among Hispanic Democrats (57%) and white Democrats (70%) than among any other Democratic candidate.
Nancy Pelosi’s overall job approval rating has become more negative over the past two years. Today, 26% say they approve of how she is handling her job as speaker, while 37% say they disapprove.
Overall, consistent conservatives are more likely than the public to vote in midterm elections. About three-quarters (73%) of consistent conservatives are likely to vote, compared with just 17% of the public overall. Among consistent liberals, just 17% are likely to vote in midterm elections.
In 2015, there were about 891,000 people living outside Somalia, according to United Nations estimates. This was more than double the estimated number of people in Kenya (440,000) and Ethiopia (44,000). The U.S. has 150,000 people in Somalia, and Djibouti is close. However, Somalia’s population has largely diversified internationally. In 2015, Somalia had 1,901 people in 31 countries, and Somalia had 2,021 people worldwide.
The new survey finds that Latinos are increasingly skeptical of the president. They are sharply divided along party lines and now say they think Trump will be a poor or terrible president. And for the first time, more say they think Trump will do a poor or terrible job than say this about any president in more than five years.
Nearly half (46%) of all U.S. adults are smartphone owners as of May 2013, an increase of 11 percentage points over the 35% of Americans who owned a smartphone last May. As in 2011, our definition of a smartphone owner includes anyone who said yes to either of the following two questions:
Most Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (87%) say it will be necessary for Congress to pass another bill to provide more federal assistance to the country, while a smaller share of Republicans and Republican leaners (66%) say this. Around three-quarters of Democrats (74%) say it will be necessary for the president and Congress to pass another bill to provide more aid.
Facing a variety of national problems – crime, drugs, corruption, terrorism, pollution and emigration – Mexicans overwhelmingly are dissatisfied with the direction of their country. With drug-related violence rated the biggest problem in Mexico, 77% mention it as a very big problem, and Mexicans overwhelmingly endorse President Felipe Calderón’s tough stance against drug traffickers.
The battleground states are largely divided on who should support Romney. In the current survey, 44% of registered voters say that, if the election were today, they would vote for Obama, while 51% support Romney. In the former Florida governor’s hometown, 53% support Romney, while the other candidate is largely absent.
Germany’s share of Protestants has decreased at a faster rate than Catholics. In 2013, the most recent year for which accurate data is available, nearly half of Germany’s total church membership rolls (49%) are Catholic. By comparison, just 37% of Germans are Catholic, and 28% are religiously unaffiliated.
Roughly two-thirds of Americans (67%) say the use of anonymous sources in the news should be always or sometimes acceptable, according to a newsroom survey conducted in February and March. A smaller share of Americans (67%) say anonymous sources should only be used in special cases.
Puerto Rico’s population has declined steadily since at least 2000, according to new Census Bureau data, but its share of the island’s total population has fallen by 14% between 2000 and 2010. The last time the island saw a slight increase was in 2000, when its share of the population was 8.2%.
On the other hand, even as Pew Internet has long been a popular online destination, many of these users are not sure where they would stand in their preferred sites. In an emergency situation, a majority of Internet users (82%) said they would continue to use their favorite website even if there was a pay wall.
More Americans get news on their devices than ever before. Half of U.S. adults own a tablet or smartphone, and 66% of those who get news on their device do so. But the use of mobile technology in this way has increased the number of people using it for news. In fact, the total number of U.S. adults who own a tablet or smartphone is estimated to be around 21 million.
By contrast, the countries of origin for international migrants in the U.S. are more diverse than those of the EU. For example, 26% of international migrants from Mexico are from the U.S., while 26% are from China, India, Philippines and Switzerland. By contrast, Morocco and Russia account for more than half of international migrants in the U.S. and EU.
The gender gap in pay has narrowed since 1980, but it has remained relatively stable over the past 15 years or so. In 2018, women earned 85% of what men earned, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of median hourly earnings of both full- and part-time workers in the United States. Based on this estimate, it would take an extra 39 days of work for women to earn what men did in 2018.
Vote casting was a key factor in the 2020 presidential election, too. A big majority of voters in the two general elections cast ballots by mail or absentee were cast in 2016, surpassing the previous two elections, which saw a similar surge in absentee voting.
With just a month to go in the recession, the number of unemployed Americans is on the rise. As of mid-2009, the Bureau of Labor Statistics had reported 2.8 million job openings, compared with 1.6 million in July 2007. The result: A slimmer pool of unemployed people is now about twice as likely as those with job openings – about 0.15 million – that’s due in no small part to the fact that there aren’t many job openings available.
Among all internet users, Facebook remains the most popular site, with 72% of women using the site, compared with only 6% of men. Site-specific social media use is measured by the percentage of men (and 5% of women) who use Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other platforms.
The rise of e-book reading is tied to the steady increase in ownership of desktop and laptop computers among adults. E-readers are now on the rise among adults, far behind other devices such as a cell phone, a desktop computer or a laptop. But the share of adults who own an e-book reader has also increased dramatically since 2009.
Like Muslims elsewhere in Europe, the French also worry more generally about the future of Muslims in their country — though, in this case, Muslims in France are significantly less worried than those in Great Britain. A majority (57%) is also at least somewhat concerned about the declining importance of religion among their co-religionists in France, though again, British Muslims are more troubled on this score with 73% sharing the worry. (In this, as in other questions in the survey, no significant difference is seen among the responses of French Muslims of Algerian, Moroccan or other ethnicity.)
A new Pew Research Center analysis based on the latest available data finds that the total number of unauthorized immigrants living in Italy is increasing since 2014. The total number of unauthorized immigrants standing in Italy is up from 2014, when about 700,000 were living there. A previous Pew Research Center estimate – which included data from Eurostat and European labor force data – shows that the number of unauthorized immigrants fluctuated between low and high levels over the past decade.
These differences in political behavior between U.S. and Democrats are also evident when looking at the political interactions between Twitter users and users on the platform. Democrats and Democratic-leaning Twitter users produce a much larger share of overall tweets from the U.S. population than are Republicans and Republican leaners. But the differences between these groups extend to how Americans behave in different settings across different political groups.
The Associated Opinion Journalists (AOJ) has been a non-profit organization for journalists for more than a decade. In 2013, 39% of journalists were members of the organization, an increase of about 6% from 2012.
The Latino vote was divided among several key demographic groups during the 2012 presidential election. For example, the Latino vote was more evenly divided among those ages 18 to 29 (74%) and those 30 to 44 (74%) than among those 18 to 29 (74%) and those 65 and older (62%). By contrast, among candidates running for president, 71% of Latinos voted for Barack Obama, a share that has not changed much over the past year.
However, there has been a significant shift in opinions over the best way to ensure peace through international military strength. In April 2007, 52% agreed that the best way to ensure peace is through military strength, while 44% disagreed. The percentage agreeing that the best way to ensure peace is through military strength has declined from 52% in 1994 to 48% today.
Younger adults are somewhat more likely to know that most immigrants are here illegally than older adults. A 58% majority of those ages 18 to 29 say most immigrants are here illegally, compared with 47% of those ages 30 to 49 and 33% of those ages 65 and older.
Most Democrats are concerned that congressional Democrats will not do enough to oppose Trump. Nearly three-quarters of Democrats (72%) say the Democratic Party will not do enough to oppose Trump, while just 20% say the same about Republicans. A majority of Democrats (56%) are also very concerned that Republicans in Congress will not do enough to oppose the president.
The Druze are divided on the importance of the religion. Around seven-in-ten Druze say being Jewish/Muslim is very important to them, and about three-quarters of Druze Muslims (72%) say the same.
It’s been seven decades since the end of the Holocaust, an event that decimated the Jewish population in Europe. In the years since then, the number of European Jews has continued to decline for a variety of reasons. And now, concerns over renewed anti-Semitism on the continent have prompted Jewish leaders to talk of a new “exodus” from the region.
A 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine highlighted consensus among scientific experts that GM foods were safe. Most Americans perceive considerable disagreement in the scientific community, however. Only a minority of Americans says that almost all (14%) or more than half (28%) of scientists agree that GM foods are safe to eat.
The percentage of online classified users who place classified ads has increased markedly since 2005, as shown in the accompanying charts. The sample of online classified users was analyzed by Pew Internet Project from March 26-April 29, 2009, as well as by the statistically significant Margins of error of 13% and 3%, respectively.
Views of both the U.S. and China have been on the decline for some time. In 2014, a median of 49% of Americans had a favorable view of the U.S., while 47% had an unfavorable view. Since 2016, favorable views of China have risen 13 percentage points in each of the 38 nations polled.
The six-party talks on North Korea – involving the United States, South Korea, North Korea, China, Japan and Russia – slated to begin Aug. 27 in Beijing reflect global public concern that the regime in Pyongyang poses a serious threat to Asian stability. But U.S. efforts to defuse the North Korean crisis take place against a backdrop of rising anti-Americanism in South Korea and occur at a time when fewer South Koreans show concern about the threat posed by their northern neighbor than do Americans, Australians and many Europeans.
Nearly half of refugees entering the U.S. this year are Muslim. The U.S. admitted the highest number of Muslim refugees in fiscal 2016 of any year since data on self-reported religious affiliations first became publicly available in 2002. A slightly lower share of 2016’s refugees were Christian (44%) than Muslim (46%), the first time that has happened since fiscal 2006, when a large number of Somali refugees entered the U.S.
Several states may be reluctant to change the Senate’s allocation, due in part to the state’s population imbalance. In the current survey, 75% of adults say the Constitution should be amended so that all states should have two senators regardless of population. The largest group (69%) of adults is from North Carolina, which has about 70,000 residents. By contrast, only 24% of adults from South Carolina and 23% from Vermont say the Constitution should be amended to allow all states to have two senators regardless of population.
‘Anger’ at government and views of GOP candidates. Donald Trump is viewed more favorably by the nearly one-third of Republicans and leaners who are angry at government (64% favorable) than by those who are frustrated or content with government (48%). Other GOP presidential candidates (Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Ben Carson) also get higher favorable ratings among Republicans who are angry at government than among non-angry Republicans, in part because they are better known among the “angry” group.
The fastest-growing counties by Hispanic population growth since 2007 are in North Dakota, which has the largest Hispanic population growth rate since the Great Recession. In 2014, 367 counties with at least 1 Latino population were in North Dakota, making up 294 counties and 117 in Ward County, North Dakota.
Ahead of the first contests in the 2020 election, Democratic voters are highly engaged with the race for their party’s nomination, express positive views of the Democratic field and are united in opposition to Donald Trump.
Meanwhile, 61% of non-internet users in India use smartphones, up from 22% in 2013. This represents a significant shift from 2013, when 83% of non-internet users had a smartphone. As of 2015, the share of non-internet users with smartphones is up from just 5%, and the share of those who own a smartphone has risen from 17% to 32%.
The public’s perceptions of economic news have not changed since the start of 2010. Currently, 54% say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy, while 30% say the news they are hearing is mostly bad and just 4% say they are hearing mostly good news.
Social media has grown as a source of news for Americans: Roughly a quarter (26%) now get news on two or more social media sites, up from 14% in 2013.

Members of the Silent Generation (born between 1928 and 1945) continue to be the least supportive of legalization: Only 35% favor legalizing marijuana, while 64% are opposed.
In a week that saw the start of the U.S. presidential campaign, the public continued to name the health care debate as its top story. More than a quarter of Americans (25%) say they followed news about the debate more closely than any other story. Another 24% say they followed news about the swine flu more closely than any other story.
But equally important is that 14% of all Americans – and 28% of gay marriage supporters – say they have changed their minds on this issue in favor of gay marriage, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted this month.
The survey finds that few Republicans and Democrats are happy with their congressional leaders. Only about a quarter (24%) of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Reid, while 42% have an unfavorable view. The turnout rate for Republican John McCain has been significantly higher since last November (from 36% to 41%).
An estimated 3.8 million Hispanics of Nicaraguan origin resided in the United States in 2013, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.
While the political spectrum is divided on the issue of drugs, the public remains divided on the issue. Just 13% of the public says the party is not fighting crime and 13% says it is not tackling the problem effectively. For instance, the PRI is leading the way on drug-related violence with 13% of support, while 23% say the party is leading with no edge.
British enthusiasm for leaving the EU has been declining ever since Cameron made his pledge. In 2013, the British public was divided on the issue, with 46% wanting to stay and 46% expressing a desire to leave. In the 2015 Pew Research Center survey, more than half of Brits (55%) say they want to remain in the EU, while just 36% say they want to go.
Most Americans think scientists should help make food policy; fewer think food industry leaders should have a major policymaking role. Despite mixed assessments of scientists working on GM food issues, six-in-ten U.S. adults (60%) say scientists should have a major role in policy issues related to GM foods and 28% say they should have a minor role. Similar shares of Americans say that small farm owners and the general public should have a major role in GM food policy. A smaller share of Americans says that food industry leaders (42%) or elected officials (24%) should have a
Such studies typically find that middle-class Americans place less emphasis on profit than other middle-class groups, though the gap is wider than for other middle-class groups. A 2012 study from the American Enterprise Institute, using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES), found that the top 20% of households by income accounted for nearly 40% of total expenditures, while the bottom 20% accounted for less than 10% of expenditures. As the chart shows, the gap between the top and bottom has remained relatively constant – a finding that largely reflects the firm’s analysis.
Overall, Americans are divided when it comes to their level of concern about surveillance programs. In a survey conducted November 2014-January 2015, 52% described themselves as “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” about government surveillance of Americans’ data and electronic communications, compared with 46% who described themselves as “not very concerned” or “not at all concerned” about the surveillance. Those who followed the news about the Snowden leaks and the ensuing debates were more anxious about privacy policy and their own privacy than those who did not.
The role of television in obtaining news has shifted dramatically over the past decade as a source of news for older Americans. Asked about four main sources of news they use for their daily lives, the vast majority of those ages 50 to 64 (81%) say they often get news on television, followed by 65% who often do so on print and radio. Just 27% of those ages 50 to 64 say they often get news on television, while 14% say they do so on social media.

Germany is a country where U.S. image has declined sharply in recent years. For example, in 2008, before the coronavirus outbreak began to spread, about a third of Germans had confidence in President Barack Obama to do the right thing in world affairs. By 2014, confidence in Obama had fallen to about a third, but by 2019 confidence had nearly doubled to about a quarter.
In 2016, a majority of 25- to 35-year-old movers were living in their parents’ home. This is a substantial increase from the 22% of movers who were renting, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data.

With the fall of the Islamic militant group ISIS, the British public has grown increasingly worried about Islamic extremism in their country. In France, where the ISIS group operates, 56% of the general public feel very concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism in their country. By contrast, in Germany, France and Spain, only 21% of the general public feel very concerned.
Public support for trade and multinational corporations and the lack of enthusiasm for protesters does not mean that people necessarily reject critics’ concerns. Majorities, in most cases strong majorities, in 34 of 44 nations thought the availability of good paying jobs had gotten worse in the last five years. And substantial majorities–82% in France, 67% in the United States, 63% in Mexico–thought the gap between the rich and the poor had worsened. But, unlike trade’s critics, the public did not blame globalization for these problems. People attributed such difficulties to domestic factors.
The report also highlights the region’s recent rise in government harassment and the use of force against religious groups.

The number of Mexican immigrants living in illegally-immigrant households declined from 2 million in 2007 to 6 million in 2012, according to new Pew Research Center estimates based on government data. This decline is due in part to a sharp decrease in the number of Mexican immigrants entering the country without authorization.
The chart below plots out the growth rates of young students ages 13 to 17 in the U.S. school system as of June 30, 2050. The non-Hispanic growth rate of 166.9% is projected to increase by 34.4%, similar to the rate of 34.6% in 1990. The change in growth rate is projected to slow down slightly, but not as fast, as it was in 1990.

A Pew Research Center survey conducted in April and May 2018 found that 54% of Americans favor the death penalty for people convicted of murder, while 39% oppose it. That was up from 2016, when 49% of U.S. adults said they favored the death penalty, compared with 42% who opposed it.

Such analyses, though, rely on projections of how many same-sex couples will want to marry. In the Pew Research Center’s recent survey of LGBT Americans, similar percentages of unmarried gay men and lesbians (56% and 58%, respectively) said they would like to get married someday; 4% of gay men and 6% of lesbians said they were currently legally married (the report did not attempt to estimate the total LGBT population).
For example, 72% of suburban residents say most people have values that are similar to or different from theirs, compared with 53% of rural residents and 46% of urban residents.

In those days, the percentage of women who say their condition is about the same as it was in the past five years, remained essentially unchanged at 54%, while the percentage saying their condition is better has risen only modestly in recent years.
Tuesday night’s botched execution of Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett is renewing debate about how, and whether, the U.S. should continue to impose the death penalty. Though a majority (59%) of Americans in the 2011 Pew Research Center survey said they favored the death penalty for convicted murderers, that was the highest support level in four decades; support has been falling for the past two decades. (Gallup’s most recent poll on the subject, from this past October, found 60% support, up from 40% in 1983.)
Support is relatively rare among the millions of Americans who have experienced harassment online.

When asked what constitutes their country’s Muslim identity, large majorities of British Muslims (81%) and Spanish (69%) say they would consider themselves to be their country’s first Muslim brother. In many cases, however, Muslim refugees abroad are divided, with the British saying they would be a nation first (and a minority saying they would be a foreigner).
The economy and jobs: Americans’ views of economic conditions are more positive than they have been in recent years. An October survey found 41% of Americans rating economic conditions in the country as “excellent” or “good,” near the highest point in a decade. The public’s improving economic outlook is reflected in its policy agenda for Trump and Congress in the coming year. Economic issues – improving the job situation, strengthening the economy and reducing the budget deficit – are now viewed as less important policy priorities than they were just a few years ago, according to a survey conducted earlier this month.
Many female Facebook users say they have increased their use of the platform. However, the majority of male Facebook users say they have increased their use of the platform in recent months, and 46% say this compared with 30% of female users.

While many international observers see China as a major power, some say it is less important to the world than others. A median of roughly six-in-ten across the 25 countries surveyed say that having China as the world’s leading power would be better for the world than it was a decade ago. By contrast, only about a third of Americans (34%) think the U.S. would be better.
Judges of the United States Supreme Court and other justices have received more votes than those of other U.S. presidents. As of March 2018, Trump’s judges had cast an average of 0.6 votes, compared with 2.6% of his predecessors, Barack Obama, Clinton and George W. Bush.
The UN has high international support. And it gets positive reviews in most of the nations polled, including Canada, the United States, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Germany, Hungary and Greece.
A look at the religious affiliation of the U.S. population reveals some differences in geographical distribution among Congresses and the religious groups that make up the majority of Americans. A recent Pew Research Center analysis based on the data from the 114th Congress found that religious affiliation among the general public increased while the general public declined. But as the religious spectrum expanded, the sharpest decline in religious affiliation occurred among Republicans. When Congress was dissolved, Republicans who identified as religiously unaffiliated fell from 28% of the general population to 21% of the general public.

But more in the most secure (61%) than in the least secure (41%) say immigrants are a burden on the country because they take their jobs hard work and talents.
Half of U.S. adults say the Bible should have a great deal or some influence on U.S. laws, while another 28% say it should have some influence. In this case, only about a quarter of Americans (26%) say the Bible should have more influence than the people of the people.
The overwhelming majority in Western Europe (68%) also believes that the U.S.-led war in Iraq aimed at making the world a safer place, including majorities in France and Spain (68% each). Fewer than half in Japan (44%) and China (34%) believe the war in Iraq made the world a more dangerous place.
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, conducted January 5-9 among 1,503 adults finds that by two-to-one (60% to 27%) Americans see China’s economic strength as a greater threat than its military strength.

Just over half of Millennials (46%) voted in 2012, compared with 39% in 2008. Voter turnout rates for the Silent generation – defined as those ages 18 and older – have historically lagged for the majority of Boomers and Silent Generation members in federal elections.
In the 2016 election, a wide gap in presidential preferences emerged between those with and without a college degree, our post-election analysis of national exit poll data found. College graduates backed Clinton by a 9-point margin (52%-43%), while those without a college degree backed Trump 52%-44%. This was by far the widest gap in support among college graduates and non-college graduates in exit polls dating back to 1980.
The survey also asked teens if they regularly see other students in their school – whether they pray before school or at least sometimes. Overall, 62% of teens ages 13-17 say they often or sometimes see other students praying before a sporting event, compared with just 16% who say this rarely or never happens. And although only 16% of teens say they often or sometimes see other students praying before eating lunch, this share is little changed from the 27% who said this in the fall of 2018.

A significantly smaller share of Republicans (74%) give officers a warm rating on the scale (51 to 75), while just 13% give a somewhat warm rating on the scale (0-49).
The balance of party identification among the public has changed little in recent years: 48% identify with the Democratic Party or are officially affiliated with it; just 21% identify as Republicans or are affiliated with it. Since 1992, only once – in 2002 – have as many people identified as Democrats or affiliated with it. This has changed little in recent years.
Bush’s strongest showing on the campaign trail has been his quadrennial win in the House of Representatives. Last week, 42% of voters said they thought of themselves as conservative, while 39% described themselves as conservative. Last week, his rate was 43%, up from 56% in August and 63% in March. Most of this increase has come among Republicans, but it is not unprecedented. For example, in March of this year, 46% of Republicans called themselves conservative, while 42% said they were very conservative.

When asked about the transferring of powers from Brussels to the EU, many Europeans are skeptical that the national government should take some powers back from the EU. In France, Germany, Italy and Spain, roughly four-in-ten feel this way strongly. A plurality in Greece (68%) and the UK (65%) think the national government should instead transfer some powers to the EU.
Like his father’s experience in his first term in office, George W. Bush’s ratings were driven largely by the public’s response to national security concerns. In the end, however, a spike in unemployment contributed to Bush’s leaving office with one of the lowest approval scores of the modern era. When Bush was inaugurated in January 1991, unemployment stood at 4.2%. The rate rose markedly following the Sept. 11 attacks, peaking at 6.3% in October 1993, not beginning a gradual decline until late that year. Nonetheless, Bush’s ratings remained high throughout as the public
Half (48%) of Americans say the U.S. should keep troops in Afghanistan until the situation there is stabilized, while 47% say the U.S. should not send troops there until the situation there is stabilized.

About two-thirds (66%) of working mothers say they spend too little time with their children, compared with 48% of working fathers.
Explicitly anti-social behavior while in public is considerably less common. Some 23% of cellphone owners say that when they are in public spaces they use their phone to avoid interacting with others who are nearby at least on occasion. Of course, those around the cellphone user may still experience various uses of cellphones as anti-social, even if that was not the intention of the user.

And marriage has become more common among millennials: Currently, 62% of adults ages 18 to 44 have cohabited, compared with 72% of those 50 and older.
Americans’ views on abortion have remained relatively steady in recent years. But 40 years after Roe v. Wade, the legal battles over abortion are far from over. In fact, there has been a substantial amount of activity at the state level, particularly in parts of the Southern and Midwestern U.S., where, according to a July Pew Research Center poll, there is greater opposition to abortion rights among the general public.
As for the population of Mexico in the U.S., it is unclear whether the current Mexican-born population is representative of the entire U.S. population.

People who have contributed money to an organization where it takes policy on gun policy are almost twice as likely as those who say it is important to control gun rights to say they would not vote for a candidate who does not agree on other gun policy (12%).
Changes in labor force participation during the recession reveal a rapidly worsening situation for foreign-born Hispanics, native-born Hispanics and blacks in the labor force. The fourth quarter of 2008 is better known as the fourth quarter of 2007, but is not as well known as the fourth quarter of 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the foreign-born Hispanics participation rate was 6.1%, compared with 6.6% for native-born Hispanics and 6.6% for blacks.

Hispanic employment was at its lowest point in more than four years, when the employment-to-population ratio between white and black employment levels were about the same as they were in the spring of 2010 (the only time the ratio was even close to 50%). In fact, the peak of the recession’s rundown was in February 2009, when the employment ratio between black and white employment ratios were about the same as it was in the spring of 2010: about 58% of whites, while just 44% of blacks did.
The overall racial and ethnic composition of immigrant eligible voters is little changed since 2012. In 2013, about 5.4 million black immigrants were eligible to vote in California, making up just over half (54%) of immigrant eligible voters. By comparison, the share of whites, blacks and Asians in these states was significantly higher than the share of black eligible voters in New York and Florida. These differences remain even as the number of white immigrants in California has grown from 2 million in 2013 to 3 million in 2018.

John Edwards in April – has leveled off in recent weeks.
But clouds loom on the horizon, as overall approval of Obama’s international policies and confidence in the American president have declined around the globe since 2009. Among Obama’s biggest problems is his administration’s drone campaign against extremist leaders and organizations. Majorities in virtually every country surveyed in 2012 oppose this policy, which is a key component of American anti-terrorism efforts. Opposition is especially prevalent in Muslim countries – at least eight-in-ten in Egypt, Jordan and Turkey are against drone strikes – but about three-quarters in Spain, Japan, Mexico and Brazil are also against drone

Looking at the various combinations of responses to those questions, this survey finds that, overall, 63% of Americans would be relatively comfortable or likely to engage with all three steps, and 54% would be relatively resistant to at least one core aspect of the process. In addition, it is more likely that some people who have seen or heard about the contact tracing process say they would be relatively comfortable or likely to engage with all three steps of the process.
A Pew Research Center poll in the seven predominantly Muslim countries surveyed last year found that women (84%) are much more likely than men (44%) to support the idea of gender segregation in the workplace.

Although China’s economy has grown consistently at above 6% for more than a decade, Americans’ views of which country – China or the U.S. – has the strongest economy have fluctuated considerably over this same period. Since 2015, however, when asked to choose between the U.S., China, Japan and the countries of the European Union as the world’s leading economic power, Americans tend to choose their own country. Today, half of Americans say the U.S. is the dominant economy, whereas roughly one-third (32%) name China – an 18 percentage point difference.
YouTube tends to recommend more popular content to users than the initial starting videos. This analysis consists of a five-step “random walks” that begins with the recommendation of specific videos to users, and ends with a series of random walks that begin with the recommendation of specific videos. Participants are given the option of selecting a video from the list of favorites, and the algorithm selects the videos from the list. At the same time, the algorithm selects the videos that are most popular, and the videos selected are selected by the most popular content in the analysis.
Most Americans continue to say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the nation’s economy, though the percentage hearing mostly bad news has ticked up since last month.

The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted April 30-May 4, finds that 44% of undecided House members are Democrats — more than twice as many as Republicans. That’s due in no small part to Democrats having sufficiently strong support for the Democrats, which peaked in the early 1990s. But the gap between Democrats and Republicans has narrowed considerably since 1990.
By a wide margin, the public has mixed views of the economy, with many citing the job situation, personal finances and the stock market as the top issue.

Remarkably, 72% said most people in Hungary are actually worse off today economically than they were under communism, while only 8% said most people are better off and 16% said things are about the same. Again, Hungary stands apart from the other post-communist societies surveyed — in no other country did so many believe that economic life is worse now than during the communist era.
Turnout in the 2014 midterm elections is still relatively high – at 0.2 percent, but it’s still higher than in 2008.

The share of adults in households with only cellphones has risen since 2004, when 75% of adults used a cellphone.
People in New Zealand have experienced some form of social hostilities related to their religion, especially when it comes to religion-related violence. In 2016, Pew Research Center scored a median of 0.9 out of 10 on the social hostilities index, which includes a 10-point gap between those who said religion was discriminated against and those who said religion was forbidden. Among the nine countries included in the study, religious restrictions continue to be the most common type of hostilities, with New Zealand experiencing the highest median level of hostility since 2007.
Trump’s ratings in Western Europe look a lot like Bush’s at the end of his tenure. While Obama was very popular in Western Europe, his presidency was bookended by two very unpopular Republican presidents. Major elements of George W. Bush’s foreign policies met with widespread opposition in the region, and by the time he left office, his ratings in countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom were quite low. Today, Trump gets similar marks as Bush in these four nations.
Since 1965, the share of the immigrant population that is white has risen from 11% to 31%. In 2015, the share that is white has risen from 8% to 31%. It is projected to double again by 2065 to become the largest racial or ethnic group in the world.

But a new Pew Research Center analysis of data from the International Monetary Fund suggests that many in Developing countries struggle to avert food shortages. The correlation is strongest in Kenya, where 0.7 percentage points are given for each of the 10 emerging markets. Elsewhere in the world, a similar pattern is evident: In the U.S., a billion-dollar relationship exists between a person in China and a person in Germany who can earn $10,800 per capita per capita. That is the strongest correlation between the PPP per capita and the dollar in the developing world.

While a few years ago, a few Japanese were still skeptical that Japan should take a more active role in the peace and stability process, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that people in the Asia-Pacific region were willing to give Japan a boost in military involvement. In 2015, a majority (62%) said that Japan should limit its role in the region. However, this came at a time when a larger share of the public (69%) said Japan should limit its role in the region.
Partisanship is a key factor in public perceptions of news organizations’ handling of political and social issues. About eight-in-ten Americans (79%) say that news organizations when presenting the news on political and social issues deal fairly with all sides, while 20% say they tend to favor one side. This is slightly higher than the share of Republicans who say this (91%).
The U.S. admitted 84,995 refugees in fiscal year 2016, the most since 1999. But where they settled varied widely, with some states taking in large numbers and others very few, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. State Department data.
War veterans will be retired by 2045, roughly double the share of all U.S. veterans who served in the past four decades. The roughly nine-in-ten veterans who served in the past two wars will be retired by 2045, according to VA population projections. They are also more likely to be in the post-9/11 wars than in the post-9/11 wars.

An analysis of the stock market’s value suggests that American incomes are losing their edge, because the after-tax incomes of wealthy people have fallen so sharply since the 1980s. Then, the stock market crash devastated the U.S. economy in the 90s, when average annual incomes fell by 6,000%, and average annual incomes grew by 6,000% after-tax. Now, the stock market’s median income is $44,500, according to New York Times/Luxembourg data, and has risen to $40,000 since 1990.
Two measures of government labor underutilization include the official U.S. unemployment rate (U-3) – which is a loose acronym for the federal government’s own measure of labor utilization – and a history of roughly a quarter of Americans who say they are unemployed. (The two are seasonally adjusted for inflation, so the underlying assumptions here are for now and not yet fully developed versions of the unemployment rate.)
Hispanics also are more likely than the U.S. public to believe in the American dream. According to a Pew Research Center survey of Latino adults conducted in August and September 2016, 77% of Hispanics said most people who want to get ahead can get ahead if they are willing to work hard and determination. About three-quarters (77%) said this compared with their parents when they were the age they were today.

The current survey finds a stagnant increase in the percentage saying that the U.S. military effort is going in Iraq, while 44% say it is not too or not at all well. This is the highest percentage expressing a sense of progress since the decision to use force in March 2004. A year ago, 54% felt that the U.S. military effort was the right decision.
The Pew Global Attitudes survey conducted in 2005 found that the Muslims in Indonesia were more likely than the other major religious groups in that country to believe that they themselves are Muslims.

Mexicans also continue to say the government’s campaign against drug traffickers is making progress. About four-in-ten (39%) believe the government is making progress, while 37% say it is losing ground. This perception has changed little since 2011, when 39% said the government was leading against drug traffickers. In 2014, it was more than double the percentage saying the government was making progress.
By 55% to 35%, Hispanics and Asian Americans say that they think being able to live and work in the U.S. legally without the threat of deportation is more important than a pathway to citizenship.

In the Pew Research Center’s most recent survey on the subject, 24% of Republicans and 19% of Democrats said they had an unfavorable opinion of the Republican Party. That was the highest share of unfavorable opinion since 1992. In the 2008 presidential election year, just 19% of Republicans held an unfavorable view of both parties.
The age gap in voter turnout is as large as it has been in decades. According to the exit polls, voters who turn 30 this year are more likely than ever to vote Democratic or Republican, even though that group has risen from 10 years ago. And that includes taking into account the fact that 51% of young voters are Democrats.
Overall, 56% of registered voters say they have given a lot of thought to the candidates for president this year, up from 28% at the same point in the 2008 campaign.

Since 2009, the share of Americans saying it is more important for blacks to protect gun rights has increased 57%, from 24% to 41%. But the share of whites saying it is more important for blacks is down 10 percentage points, from 45% in 1993 to 56% in 2012.
A Pew Research Center poll after the Sandy Hook shootings found a modest uptick in the percentage of Americans saying it’s more important to control gun ownership than protect the right of Americans to own guns. But a bill that proposed tighter background checks failed in the Senate in April and by May the uptick in support for gun control fell back down. According to an analysis of state gun laws by The New York Times, more states have loosened gun restrictions than tightened them since the Connecticut school shooting.

Latinos have an overwhelming internet access at home compared with whites, and these gaps are not limited to just the internet. For example, more than eight-in-ten Latinos (85%) go online at home, compared with 66% of whites and 63% of blacks.1 On the internet, however, there are significant racial and ethnic differences in broadband use – a trend that is consistent with the overall U.S. population.
When people are online, they engage in various forms of social networking. For instance, 88% of online Egyptians report that they use Facebook and similar websites like Twitter, and 86% of Russian internet users say they do not use these sites.

The poverty rate among all Hispanics was 21.4% in 2015, down from 15.6% in 2010. For example, the percentage of all Hispanic households living in poverty has been decreasing since the Great Recession, when it hit 12.4%. Meanwhile, the share of all Hispanic households living in poverty has increased from 14.4% in 2010 to 15.4% in 2015.

The Internet is home to many of America’s oldest and most beloved digital devices, and those who do visit the internet often find themselves in other countries visiting friends and family, taking photos or downloading videos. Some of the sites that we recently visited include YouTube, the site that lets users share their photos and videos online, and the music streaming sites that allow people to stream and download audiobooks, music and video. Among the general public, mobile phones, tablets and computers are the most popular devices, as well. However, those who visit the internet on a cell phone are far more likely than others to say that they

A similar share (34%) says private investment will be enough to ensure enough progress even without government funding.
The Pearson correlation is not linear, but it does show a strong relationship between the productivity of workers’ labor force and the use of reading skills at work. The Pearson correlation is essentially unchanged since 2012, when the Center first asked the question. (The bold line represents the best linear prediction of the relationship between labor productivity and the use of reading skills at work.)
Numerous public reports last year about the sexual abuse scandals in the U.S. have been reported by various public organizations and organizations, but most of them involve elected officials. The number of such scandals in the U.S. – and nearly all of them – is linked to a widespread belief that officials often get caught up in greater scrutiny.
Support for the death penalty in the U.S. has ticked up recently, but is far lower than it was two decades ago. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in April and May 2018 found that 54% of Americans favor the death penalty for people convicted of murder, while 39% oppose it. That was up from 2016, when 49% of U.S. adults said they favored the death penalty, compared with 42% who opposed it. But it was far lower than in 1996, when 78% of Americans supported capital punishment for those convicted of murder.

Yet half said the financial markets were mixed, virtually unchanged from last month.
If the narrative that polls are broken is correct, one place it is likely to manifest is in trend-lines for these fundamental concepts. Specifically, two trend lines (one line for the benchmark high response rate survey and one line for the telephone poll) which used to be similar back in the 1990s or early 2000s, for example, perhaps would have been expected to diverge by 2016, as single-digit polls are no longer capable of producing unbiased estimates. This scenario is not borne out in the data.
About eight-in-ten Republicans (77%) today say they are either optimistic (22%) or pessimistic (39%) about the future of their party. By contrast, in late 2016, more Republicans expressed optimism than pessimism (77% vs. 39%) about the future of their party.

In South and Central Asia, women make up 50% of the ambassadors, accounting for 50% of them in South Asia and Pacific.
People are also generally positive about the benefits of more international cooperation. When asked whether more cooperation would have led to fewer coronavirus cases in their country, nearly eight-in-ten in Denmark (78%) and Australia (59%) say this.

More than four-in-ten Germans say the U.S. is either their country’s first or second most important partner. Americans are much less likely to see Germany this way: Only 12% name Germany as one of America’s top two partners. Still, Germany does make the top four, trailing

The recent survey also found that the pontiff’s overall approval rating among
This analysis is based on a survey of 2,003 adult internet users conducted between March 8 and May 11 of 2009, and includes questions on internet users’ online behavior.

As is the case in views of free speech, there’s little relationship between dissatisfaction with democracy or the perception that a country’s laws protect freedom of speech and views about whether that country has an appropriate political voice. Those who live in countries where freedom of speech is guaranteed are less likely to feel that democracy is working in their country, while those who live in countries where freedom of speech is guaranteed are less likely to feel that way.

In many countries surveyed, either the majority or plurality have favorable views of both the U.S. and China, but not the other way around. And in some countries, such as Brazil, Spain and Sweden, almost half or more say they have favorable views of both the U.S. and China.

But if you’re one of the main opposition groups in the Syrian refugee issue, you’re much less likely to have heard of someone who wants to seek asylum there. You’re probably also familiar with how asylum rates vary across the different countries you’re applying to.

In 1968, 36% of young adults were living with the home of the other person, but regardless of the person’s marital status or stepchild.
When asked whether they would like more federal funding for scientific research to be increased, about half of Americans (52%) say this, while 31% say funding should stay about the same and just 1% say it should be decreased. The share saying this would not be changed has dropped from about 10% in 2007, but it is about the same as it was in 2001.
Overall, just 33% of Americans are satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S., while 56% are dissatisfied. The public is slightly more dissatisfied (51%) than satisfied (33%). Overall, 44% of Americans say they are satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S., while 41% say they are not too or not at all satisfied.
The share of people who say their own country’s economic situation is bad has also been higher in Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, the UK, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. (Unemployment data from Eurostat, accessed Nov. 12, 2019)
Republicans and Democrats are far more likely to say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases than to say that it should be legal (77% vs. 22%). Among Democrats, 57% say abortion should be legal, while 41% say it should be illegal.
The study finds that people have a negative view of China and are skeptical of Beijing’s record on human rights. For instance, 100 percent of people in each country surveyed say Beijing does not respect personal freedoms, a relationship that is essentially unchanged since 2017.
The U.S. received 84,995 refugees in fiscal year 2019, more than the total from the Democratic Republic of Congo (12,958), Burma (Myanmar) (4,932) and Ukraine (4,412). The Democratic Republic of the Congo (3,958) was the top origin country of refugees in 2019.
This anger plays a large role in the high level of enthusiasm among Democratic voters. Fully 71% of Democratic voters who describe themselves as “angry” at government say they are more enthusiastic about voting this year, compared with 45% of those who are “frustrated” or “basically content” with government. Similarly, Democrats who register strong disapproval of the president are far more likely to be eager to vote than those with less strong views (58% vs. 29% enthusiastic). And 56% of Democrats who say their congressional vote is a vote against the president express high enthusiasm about 2006,
The differences are striking across party lines, but they remain substantial, and they are particularly striking across partisan lines. Pew Research Center’s political values study — which used to measure party affiliation and party affiliation — found that Democrats and Republicans have historically been the more supportive of the environment than they have been of the Republicans. And it is that divide that has persisted even as the GOP has taken office.
Despite the overall negativity about mobile technology across the countries surveyed, mobile phone non-users in these countries are often more opposed to buying a device. For example, nearly nine-in-ten leaners who do not use mobile phones say they do not want to get a mobile phone in the future. A median of 47% of mobile non-users in these eight countries say they do not want a mobile phone in the future. Meanwhile, roughly six-in-ten Tunisians (61%) and four-in-ten Indians (41%) say they do not want a mobile
While the Boston bombings riveted most Americans, the incident appeared to confirm the public’s long-held belief that occasional terrorist acts are to be expected. Over the past decade, majorities have consistently said that “occasional acts of terrorism in the U.S. will be part of life in the future.” This sentiment has spiked to 75% in the wake of the Boston bombings from 64% a year ago and now matches the previous high of 74% in 2003.
And what’s behind the scenes? In Athenistan, Libya? No matter what you think, the public sees the U.S. doing very or somewhat well. A majority (55%) says things are going very or somewhat well for the U.S., while just 38% say things are going very or somewhat badly. In October 2008, a majority (56%) said the U.S. handled things in Afghanistan very or fairly well.
Support for the U.S. among America’s biggest fans is concentrated in Middle Eastern countries. The U.S. is popular in nearly every country surveyed, but that predominantly occurs in Muslim countries. The Muslim world’s biggest fan is Lebanon (41%), while only 16% see the U.S. favorably.
But while a significant share of Twitter users – on average – posted about immigration-related topics at least once a week during Trump’s presidency, the impact of the second term was smaller. A small share (32%) of daily tweeters posted about immigration topics with a link to at least one of the two weekly links, compared with 19% of hourly tweeters. (The larger share of tweeters focused on topics other than immigration than the most recent link during Trump’s presidency.)
Even as many YouTube users say the site plays an important role in helping them navigate various aspects of their lives, it can also be a space where they encounter troubling or problematic content. Around two-thirds of users (64%) say they at least sometimes encounter videos that seem obviously false or untrue while using the site. A similar share (60%) say they at least sometimes encounter videos that show people engaging in dangerous or troubling behavior. A minority of users also say they see videos that are abusive or demeaning toward others – and 11% say they see this type of content frequently.
Just 14% have confidence in Obama to do the right thing in world affairs. In Paris, Obama was already well-regarded, but his ratings have declined a bit over time. Between 2009 and 2010, French confidence in Obama dropped by 10 points, and Obama’s ratings slipped a bit more – from 77% to 86% – in France. (The difference between the two is about the same across the political spectrum.)

As Figure 1, most internet users have purchased at least one of several online content types.
The proportion of Americans who read books has been steadily declining over the past year, though it is more common to find them in audiobooks and printed books.
Support for President Maduro is up 34 percentage points from a spring 2014 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center. The president’s personal favorability rating is at its highest point in nearly two decades. Only 36% of Venezuelans express a favorable opinion of the president, while 55% hold an unfavorable view.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Catholics are more evenly distributed throughout the country. While in the South, 26% of Catholics live in the South, 26% live in the West and 23% are in the South. In addition, 37% of the general public and 18% of Catholics in the South are in the Midwest, and 23% live in the South.
However, it’s not the case that the conversation itself is all about politics or public affairs. Just over two-thirds of Americans (66%) say they discuss politics or public affairs with others “always” at least once a day, with just 15% saying they do so at least once a day. Another 11% say they never discuss politics or public affairs with others, and 5% say they do not use the internet at all.
The Army and National Guard complement each other in many ways. By providing more representation to the public, the Army makes up a smaller share of the overall U.S. military than the Army. The Army makes up 24% of the total, while the National Guard takes a more limited role. The Marine Reserve makes up 7% of the U.S. Marine Corps, while the Navy makes up just 1% of the Army.
In Brazil, 85 percent of those who say the country is facing a serious climate change complaint say the same. Two-thirds or more in Turkey, Lebanon, South Korea, Argentina, Kenya and Japan say the same.
A majority of white evangelical Protestants (57%) approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president, but just 36% of black Protestants say the same. And while a majority of white Catholics (60%) say they approve of Trump’s performance, only about a quarter (26%) say the same.
There are ideological differences within the GOP in views of stricter environmental laws and the economy. Nearly seven-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (74%) say stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost, compared with just 15% of Democrats and Democratic leaners.
Americans are closely divided on the march’s goals and whether the marches will have an impact on support for science. 48% of Americans say they support the goals of the marches, while 44% say they strongly oppose them. Smaller shares of the public say they don’t know how the marches will affect support for science: 26% say they support the marches, while 44% say they will hurt public support.
The public does not know whether or not big donors have more influence. In fact, 43% of Americans say “people who give a lot of money to elected officials do not have more influence than others” describes the country very or somewhat well, with just 11% saying this very well.
A 64% majority of Americans say Trump has definitely or probably done unthical things, while about a third (32%) say he probably or definitely has not done things that are illegal. Very few Republicans (45%) say Trump has definitely not done things that are illegal.
A small share of America’s teens are familiar with Facebook, but they tend to be more likely to come from lower-income households. Teens from households earning less than $30,000 a year are more likely to use Facebook than teens from higher-income households (70% vs. 36%), a 2018 Center survey found. By contrast, 72% of teens from households earning $75,000 or more a year say they use the site, compared with 36% of teens from households earning $75,000 or more a year.
A larger share of Americans say it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns than to control gun ownership (52% vs. 42%). However, the share saying it is more important to protect gun rights has increased 11 percentage points since 2014, when it was 76%.
Perceptions of voter partisanship vary greatly by county and state. For example, 37% of those who live in counties where Trump was registered to vote say that the person they live in was most supportive of Clinton, while just 22% say they were most likely to vote for Clinton. By contrast, 58% of Democrats and Democratic leaners who live in counties where Trump was registered to vote say they were most supportive of Clinton by 20 to 40 percentage points, while 42% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they are not most supportive of Trump.
But generations cover a long period of time. Generations typically encompass a cohort of people born over a 15- to-18-year span; for example, the Baby Boom generation includes people born between 1946 and 1964. As a result, the formative political experiences of the youngest and oldest members of each generation can differ considerably, and these differences may be reflected in divergent political attitudes and partisanship within generations.
The Navy Yard shooting rampage in Newtown, Conn., has been the public’s top story since last week. Fully 44% say they followed news of the shooting very closely, up from 33% last week. Other news stories came in second, with 28% saying they followed news about the shooting very closely.
Across 10 European countries recently surveyed by Pew Research Center, a median of 53% say immigrants make their countries stronger because they take jobs and social benefits. At the same time, Europeans also say immigrants are more to blame for crime than other groups in Europe – but that they are also more likely to raise the risk of terrorism in their country (57% vs. 38%).
Adults ages 35 and older now live in two-person households with at least three people, up from 22% in 2010. In 2017, 96% of adults ages 35 and older live in these types of households, up from 22% in 2010. The share of adults in these types of households has risen from 25% in 2010 to 47% in 2017. The share of adults in these types of households has risen from 25% in 2010 to 47% in 2017.
Such a move, representing a major shift change in relations with a country that had been a key ally in the Mideast, generally has support among the U.S. public, if recent polls are an indicator. A Pew Research Survey conducted in August found that 51% of Americans believed the U.S. should cut off military aid to Egypt to pressure the government there to end the violence against anti-government protesters while 26% said it would be better to continue military aid as a means of maintaining U.S. influence.
A new Pew Research Center analysis based on European data sources estimates that at least 3.9 million unauthorized immigrants – and possibly as many as 4.9 million – lived in Europe in 2017. The total is up from 2014, when 33.9 million to 5.3 million unauthorized migrants lived in Europe, but is little changed from a recent peak of 4.1 million to 5.3 million in 2016.
The survey also asked Americans why they think it is important to have high-speed internet access at home. A majority of white adults (45%) say broadband is essential, while 46% say it is not too important or not at all important. However, the share of white adults who say broadband is essential has increased modestly during this time period.
Among those aware of the allegations, 46% say the U.S. sanctions against Russia are “about right” and 27% say they go too far. Nearly half (47%) of Republicans who heard about the allegations say the U.S. actions against Russia are “about right.” Fewer than half (37%) of Democrats think the U.S. actions are “about right.”
Currently, 51% of Americans favor allowing more offshore oil and gas drilling in U.S. waters while 41% are opposed. In June, during the Gulf of Mexico oil leak, there was more opposition (52%) than support (44%) for increased offshore drilling.
When asked which is more important, for Trump or democracy, a 56% majority says it is more important to maintain democratic stability, even if it is not fully democratic. Since 2012, the share of Americans who view democracy as more stable has increased by 13 percentage points (from 38% to 56%). By contrast, when the presidential election comes, only 38% say that maintaining democracy is more important, even if it is not fully democratic.
While the Iranian government has expressed strong support for the nuclear agreement, the country’s support for it has declined over the past year. In a separate survey conducted Sept. 3-7, half of Americans (49%) say they approve of the agreement, while just 22% disapprove.
GOP leaders receive far lower ratings for their job performance than Democratic leaders. Just 9% say they approve of the job Democratic leaders in Congress are doing, down from 34% last month.
Three-in-ten Americans followed news about the campaign very closely and 28% listed this as the single news story they were following more closely than any other. The national news media, meanwhile, focused heavily on the campaign last week, devoting 31% of its overall coverage to election news, according to Pew’s PEJ.
As is the case in views of free speech, there is a strong political appetite across the 34 countries surveyed. A median of 44% are dissatisfied with the way democracy is working in their country, while 52% are satisfied.
A much larger share of the public gives Mexico a cold than positive rating on the “feeling thermometer” scale – a scale that ranges from 0 to 100 – than does Canada, which has a similar range. More than six-in-ten Americans (62%) say they feel very coldly toward Mexico, while 26% give a very cold rating. Only about one-in-ten (13%) feel somewhat warmly toward Canada, and just 9% say they feel very coldly toward the U.S.
But as the European Union considers further sanctions on Russia for its role in the standoff in the Ukraine-Mexico border, the Ukrainian public is more hostile to the U.S. than toward Russia. According to a spring 2014 Pew Research Center survey, about half of Ukrainians (51%) thought the European Union was having a good influence on their country, compared with 33% who said the same about the United States. By comparison, just 22% of Americans and 67% of Russians felt the same way about the U.S. and 67% felt the U.S. was having
For the first time, the Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project has found that cell phone ownership among adults in more than 40 nations has surpassed that of China, the U.S., Kenya, Mexico and Pakistan. Cell phones have become more common in China and the U.S. than they were in 2002, when 95% of adults in each country owned a cell phone. Later, the Pew Research Center found that the U.S. Cell Phone Crisis was a very big problem for many Americans, especially young people. Although there is a relatively small number of adults still own
The percentage of teens who own cell phones has been slowly rising in recent years, as more adults have adopted smartphones and mobile devices. The number of teens and adults who own cell phones has also been increasing for several years. Pew Internet Project surveys of teens ages 12 to 17 found that the margin of error in survey responses was +3% for teens, and 82% for adults.
The number of Latino eligible voters increased 6.2% between 2014 and 2017 (36,500) across the congressional districts, according to an analysis of American FactFinder data. In contrast, Latinos increased slightly by 23% between 2014 and 2017 among all congressional districts.
The American Family is changing. The share of children living with two married parents in their first marriage has also changed dramatically, from 15% in 1960 to 46% in 2013. Meanwhile, the share of children living with two married parents has increased from 15% to 16%.
Trade with other non-TPP nations – Japan, France, Mexico and the United States – is linked to more job creation than other TPP nations. Across the TPP nations surveyed, a median of 50% across five countries say trade creates jobs in their countries. Only 24% point to the U.S., while 20% point to France.
Since January there has been a decline in the percentage saying the government’s anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough in protecting the country. At that time, 58% said the government’s policies have not gone far enough in protecting the country, while 35% said they have gone too far in restricting civil liberties. Just 29% said they feel that the government’s policies have not gone far enough in national security, while 47% said they have gone too far in restricting civil liberties.
Rather than crushing them with too much information and making it hard to find useful material, most Americans say the internet and cell phones have brought benefits in learning, sharing and diversifying the flow of information into their lives. A new survey by the Pew Research Center finds that the vast majority of Americans believe their use of the web helps them learn new things, stay better informed on topics that matter to them, and increases their capacity to share ideas and creations with others.
Half of Americans say their country is the world’s leading economic power. By contrast, Germans are more likely to name China (53%) than the U.S. (42%).
The grim public mood is reflected in the record share of voters who want most members of Congress defeated in next year’s midterm elections. Nearly three-quarters (74%) of registered voters would like to see most members of Congress defeated; during the 2010 and 2006 election cycles, which both culminated in shifts in control of the House, no more than 57% in each of these two cycles wanted most members of Congress not to be reelected.
The proportion of Americans who read a printed book in the past year is up from 28% in 2013, but is little changed from the share who read a printed book in 2011 to 63%. Meanwhile, 71% of U.S. adults say they have read a book in any format in the previous 12 months, up from 28% who said the same in 2015.
Newspapers received more federal government loans than other industries, but the breadth of the funding provided by these programs varied. Newspaper companies received an average of 84% of PPP loans to companies with loans of less than $150,000. The average number of newspaper companies receiving these loans was 2,325, or 26%, of the loans awarded to newspapers. The amount of newspaper employment per loan was also significantly smaller than the amount of smaller loans offered. Newspaper companies with smaller amounts of funding reported more jobs than those with smaller loans.
Despite some of the negative assessments about the credibility of news stories, about half of U.S. adults (47%) say the use of anonymous sources has a great deal or some influence on whether they think news stories are credible, according to the survey. That is about twice as many as those who oppose the use of anonymous sources, though there are some differences by this measure between those who think the use of anonymous sources is acceptable in some cases and those who think it is never acceptable.
The most common way people can be counted as multiracial is to indicate that at least one of their parents was not the same race as them or that one of their parents was different racial. In this case, first, they can be multiracial for themselves if they do not select two or more races for themselves and their parents, or they can select two or more races for at least one of their grandparents. If they do not fit the definition of multiracial based on their parents, they can also be counted as multiracial for themselves if they
A new Pew Research Center survey examines these perceptions and patterns of leadership in organizations. For example, among the 500 companies included in the survey, three-quarters (76%) said in a 1987 Pew Research Center survey that women preferred a boss who was an “elite” woman. In the same survey, only 23% of women preferred a woman as their chief executive, compared with 48% of men. But among the 500 companies where the preference for women has changed, the share of women choosing a woman has nearly doubled since 1950.
Americans have a choice between two types of greetings: Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays. About half of Americans (52%) say it doesn’t matter how stores greet customers for Christmas, while 45% say it does. In 2005, about half (52%) said they would rather see stores, or businesses, greeting customers with a Merry Christmas or Happy Holiday greeting.
Majorities in most of the 33 non-U.S. countries surveyed disapprove of the U.S. increasing tariffs on imported goods from other countries (median 68% disapproval), its withdrawal from international climate change agreements (66%), and its construction of a wall on the border between the U.S. and Mexico (60%). Trump’s position of allowing fewer immigrants into the U.S. and his administration’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal also are met with negativity: Across all countries surveyed, medians of 55% and 52%, respectively, dis
The public has broad confidence in how CDC, state and local officials are responding to the coronavirus outbreak. Nearly seven-in-ten (78%) say they are either very (43%) or somewhat (49%) confident that their state and local elected officials are doing a good job. By contrast, just 28% think President Donald Trump is doing a good job.
In the United States, Americans and Mexicans have generally positive views of one another, but these differences have grown wider since Pew Research Center began asking these questions in 2004. As of 2017, roughly two-thirds of Mexicans (66%) had a positive opinion of the United States.
Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say they have given a lot of thought to this November’s election. The widest gap is between Democrats and Republicans, which has emerged since May, when 72% of Democrats said they had given a lot of thought to the election.
A year ago, partisan differences over the accuracy of news stories were palpable. Across party lines, the percentage saying that news stories often are inaccurate has increased by 10 percentage points — from 66% to 55%.
The influence of science knowledge on energy attitudes is also dependent on political party affiliation. For example, 85% of those with on-shore oil and gas drilling in the U.S. favor expanding offshore oil and gas drilling, while 64% are opposed. Yet, support for expanding on this source is much lower among those with low science knowledge. For example, 84% of those with high levels of science knowledge favor expanding offshore energy, while just 34% are opposed.
Another interesting way to look at the current workforce is to look at the specific types of occupations for which the newly-overtime eligible workforce is confined. According to our analysis of recent Census Bureau data, the estimated number of overtime workers in 2014 ranged from about 24,000 to 24%.
That year, according to new Pew Research Center data, the U.S. per capita trade deficit with Germany stood at $1,072 per capita in 2015. It stands at a $1,270 per capita trade advantage with Germany, a significantly larger advantage than trade deficit with China, which was accumulated only through the U.S.-China merger.
The United States is home to more college-educated immigrants than any other country. As of 2015, there were 14.7 million immigrants ages 25 and older with a postsecondary diploma or college degree living in the U.S. – more than triple the number in Canada (3.4 million) and more than four times as many as in the United Kingdom (3.4 million), according to a recent Pew Research Center report.
Democrats continue to give officers high marks on the 76-100 scale, a highly contested concept. More than seven-in-ten Democrats (69%) give officers a warm rating on the 76-100, while just 23% of Republicans take a neutral view.
In the wake of two high-profile shootings in the early summer, a sizable majority of Americans say it is more important to control gun ownership than to protect the rights of Americans to own guns. In the new survey, 47% say it is more important to control gun ownership, while 46% say it is more important to protect gun rights.
While online political donations have grown more common since 2008, most donors still make their political contributions online. In 2012, a 69% majority of political donations were made online, with online donations accounting for just over one-third of all political donations. However, political donations still occur most often when they are offline, with one-third of donations occurring only online.
The public’s perceptions of economic news remain mixed, but are far less positive than earlier this year. Roughly half (53%) say they are hearing mostly bad economic news while a majority (54%) hear a mix of good and bad news. Last month, 44% said they were hearing mostly bad news while just 6% said they were hearing mostly good news.
The June survey also shows the public is unlikely to be satisfied with the Supreme Court’s ruling – no matter what the court decides. Whether the Court decides to uphold the entire law, overturn the entire law, or reject the “individual mandate” while allowing the rest of the law to remain in place, fewer than half of Americans say they would be happy with the decision.
White Democrats continued to express greater confidence in police officers than black Democrats, especially when compared with black Democrats. Today, 78% of white Democrats say they have a great deal or fair amount of confidence in police officers to act in the public interest, compared with 53% of black Democrats.
Most Americans say China is the world’s leading military power. Around eight-in-ten Americans (83%) say the U.S. is the leading military power, including 41% who say it is better for the world if China is the world’s leading power. Similar shares of Americans say they should be the world’s leading military power (83%), while 9% say China is not.
Overall interest in news about terror incidents in the United States has risen steadily over the past decade. In the first quarter of 2010, a quarter of Americans (26%) followed news about the shootings in Norway very closely. But that figure declined to 29% after the December 2012 attack in Mumbai, India.
Nearly half of Americans (49%) say the government has gone too far in regulating financial institutions. By contrast, 63% of Republicans say the government has gone too far in regulating institutions, while 29% of Democrats say the government has gone too little.
More than eight-in-ten (78%) Americans say the health care debate affects them personally, down slightly from the 78% that said the same in mid-July. In the current survey, 21% say it does not affect them personally, up slightly from 21% in July.
Awareness of the potential for government intervention on home phone calls has risen in recent years, with the percentage of Americans who say they have considered Volpe for home call service increased from 37% in July to 35% currently. And while Volpe has not changed the minds of many Americans, awareness of the possibility of home call service is at its highest point in history.
Of the nearly seven-in-ten recent journalism and mass communication degree recipients who have received their degree this year are doing this type of work, half are writing and editing for the Web and 40% are creating and publishing content for mobile devices. Two-thirds (67%) are also developing content for blogs and internet applications.
The latest national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Jan. 23 to Feb. 9, 2014, finds that nearly three-quarters of Americans (76%) favor keeping immigrants in the U.S. illegally to be eligible for citizenship if they meet certain requirements, while 23% oppose that path. But there is far more opposition in the Tea Party — 66% support keeping immigrants in the U.S. illegally, even if they meet certain requirements.
While the public has divided over whether it is more important to protect gun rights, the balance of opinion is nearly the same as it was in 2014, when the question was first asked. Today, a 56% majority of adults say it is more important to control gun ownership, while 47% say it is more important to protect gun rights.
General David Bonds’s long-awaited progress report on the Iraq war made the Iraq policy debate last week’s most heavily covered news story — 26% of all national news coverage was devoted to this story. The public focused intently on Iraq as well. The campaign was the story that received the most coverage: 31% of the public followed campaign news very closely and 20% listed this as their most closely followed story of the week. Campaign news made up 16% of the newshole with a clear focus on Iraq. One-in-five paid very close attention to the story. Democrats (39%) were
The share of the nation’s population growth attributed to new births to Hispanics grew by 39% between 2012 and 2013, a share largely driven by U.S. births. By contrast, Hispanics grew by 39% of the total population – a share primarily driven by U.S. births. (The share of Hispanic births minus deaths was 61%), a share largely driven by U.S. births.)
The public is fully in favor of NASA, with 68% saying they have a favorable opinion of the space agency, and much higher than it was for those who did not go to college. But there is no clear winner in the race for the public’s attention, with just 17% expressing a favorable opinion, according to a January survey.
As the U.S. Supreme Court weighs its case this week in Washington on Marijuana legalization, 57% of Americans say they favor legalizing the drug, compared with 42% who are opposed, according to the General Social Survey. This stands in contrast to views taken from newspapers, television, radio and online surveys, and is not marijuana legal in every country studied.
While there is considerable public support for allowing transgender people to use public restrooms of their current gender identity, the public is more divided on this issue than it is on discrimination. Roughly half (51%) of U.S. adults say transgender people should be able to use restrooms of their current gender, regardless of whether they were born or not. Meanwhile, 46% of adults say transgender people should be able to use restrooms of their own gender, regardless of their current gender identity.
As President Obama prepares to address the nation about climate change, the public continues to have more positive views of group conflicts than other Americans.

R&D spending in the U.S. is rising over the past decade, as the EU and Japan each had billions of dollars worth of R&D spending. As of 2018, the U.S. was the only country in which ever more R&D spending was equal to purchasing power parity. The exception was Taiwan, where the P&P 500 was worth 10 billion U.S. dollars in 2019.

Obama’s average lead across the six surveys was 9.9 points among registered voters when cell phone and landline interviews were combined and weighted. If estimates had been based only on the weighted landline samples, Obama’s average lead would have been 7.6 points, an average bias of 2.3 percentage points on the margin, or about 1.2 points expressed as candidate error. Limiting the analysis to likely voters rather than all voters produced similar results. Obama’s average

A new Pew Research Center survey shows that across 40 countries surveyed in 2015, a median of 67% use the internet and 43% report owning a smartphone. But one trend stands out: People in emerging and developing nations are quickly catching up to those in advanced nations in terms of access to technology.
There are several key differences among self-identified Hispanics in these views as well. First, most self-identified Hispanics say that speaking Spanish is not enough to be considered a Hispanic. Only 15% of self-identified Hispanics say they need to have a Spanish last name to be considered self-identified.
A majority of voters express confidence that absentee and mail-in ballots will be counted as intended in in-person.

The share of Americans who say they have ever used a dating site or app is on the rise, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults.
Public attention to the major oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico has yet to drop off as significantly as media coverage. Currently, 39% say they followed news about the leak very closely last week, not much different from the 42% that said this one week earlier. Still, that is down sharply from 59% in the July 22-25 survey. More than four-in-ten (44%) say this was the story they followed most closely last week.
Positive tests for COVID-19 have found a wide range of opinions among Americans. More than half (52%) say it is acceptable for the government to use people’s cellphones to track the location of those who have tested positive for the virus to understand how the virus is spreading, but a somewhat smaller share (48%) believes this is unacceptable to do.
Mexican Catholics are divided on the issue of marriage: 48% of Mexican priests want priests to marry, while 31% want priests to get married.

The United States is seen as the most disliked nation in Western Europe, but its image is largely negative in many countries. Majorities in 14 of 23 countries have a negative opinion of the U.S. And ratings of Iran are even worse among some of America’s closest allies in Europe.
Most Republicans and Republican leaners say Trump has done too little in distancing himself from white nationalist groups. About two-thirds of Republicans (56%) say Trump has done too little in distancing himself from these groups, while slightly fewer Democrats (26%) say he has done too little.
Americans are strong in their opposition to a proposal to change Medicare into a program that would give future private participants a credit toward purchasing health insurance coverage.

Presidential job approval ratings from Ike to Obama
More than half of Millennials (55%) say they have ever shared a selfie on a social networking site such as Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat, compared with 24% of Gen Xers and 24% of Baby Boomers.

When it comes to broader issues affecting the lives of U.S. Hispanics, many say the importance of preserving their ancestral language is high. For example, in 2011, roughly three-quarters of Hispanics said it was very important that future generations of living in the U.S. be able to speak their ancestral language. By contrast, just over half of Asian Americans (45%) and all other Hispanics surveyed said this was very important.
Nearly half of the public says they heard nothing at all last week about the murder trial in Orlando, Fla.: 35% say they heard a lot about this, while 40% say they heard a little.
For example, among those who have heard of Rush Limbaugh at all, 86% say they trust and distrust the Fox News Channel, while just 10% say they trust and distrust. That is comparable to the shares who trust and distrust each of these four television sources outside their core audience.
The public places less importance on a number of ideals, values and experiences, but the importance of achieving the American dream is clearly diminished by the size of the corporation. When asked about specific goals for the future, just four-in-ten Americans say having a good family life, having a good family life, being wealthy and having a successful career are essential to the American dream, while 49% say they are not essential.
Despite diplomatic difficulties related to the Middle East and North Africa, Americans and Europeans have not necessarily agreed on NATO.

The 8.8 percent of the Chinese public thinks their country’s economic situation will improve over the next 12 months, a 9 point increase from 2013. Six points above the UK’s economic woes, people in Japan are generally more skeptical. And in many developing economies, the public also sees the economic situation in their country’s economy failing. For example, eight-in-ten or more say the economy will worsen over the next 12 months in Japan, France and Italy.
Doctors, nurses and other hospital staff around the country have raised concerns about a shortage of medical supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The fertility rate of Canada’s women ages 25 to 29 has been steadily rising since the 1960s, largely due to changes in the fertility rate of young Canadian women. In 2011, it was more than 100 babies per 1,000 Canadian women ages 25 to 29. The rate of fertility among this group also increased to a record high in 2011.
But while the public’s confidence in God has declined, so too has the share of Americans who say they are absolutely certain about their belief in God. A sharp decline in the share of Americans who say they believe in God has occurred across a range of religious groups, from the religiously unaffiliated (such as those who identify with the New Testament or those who identify with the New Testament). These declines have occurred across a range of groups, from religious groups that have traditionally been more religious than those who identify with the New Testament.
The public showed more interest in news about flooding along the Mississippi River and the continuing struggles of the U.S. economy than in news about the former IMF leader, Strauss-Kahn.

Although the 114th Congress now comprises 16 members, there are 17 members of each party, a slight increase from the previous Congress, which ran twice as often as the 114th (because it had only one senator and two members). In both states, split delegations have fallen 18 percentage points each. This is especially the case for the 115th Congress, which ran two sessions at once and then switched to one session each.
But a new Pew Research Center analysis of 2011 American Community Survey data shows that breadwinner wives make up a smaller share of all married couples. We found that in about three-quarters of these couples, about one-in-four (22%) are married to a breadwinner wife, compared with just 7% of those in between the ages of 18 to 29.
The survey also asked whether, when asked if body cams would change the behavior of police officers, whites and blacks were more likely than whites to say such cameras would make them less likely to act appropriately. About half of all white officers (49%) said they would make no difference in how police act when dealing with the public, while just 4% of black officers said they would make less sense.
As the share of Americans who take part in major political campaigns has grown, the share of college graduates who are consistently liberal has declined. In 2015, 23% of Americans with college degrees were either consistently liberal (10%) or mostly liberal (23%) – a difference that has remained virtually constant since 1994.
A median of 21% of gay men and lesbians say they knew someone who might be gay or bisexual when they came out, compared with 8% of gay men and 7% of lesbians. But when those who knew they were coming out knew more than someone else; fewer than half (median of 34%) said they knew someone who might be gay and 7% said they were not sure.
While the media focused intently last week on the escalating debate over U.S. policy in Iraq, the public took a typical summer hiatus from the major news stories of the week. The Iraq war, rather than the policy debate, was the news story the public focused on most closely, but even attention to the war was down substantially from previous weeks. A quarter of the public paid very close attention to events in Iraq, down from 36% the week before and the lowest level recorded this year. Roughly the same proportion (23%) listed the war as the single news story they followed more closely
The public is divided over the use of drones. Half say the U.S. has become safer from terrorism, while 31% say drones have made the country less safe. Just 14% say the drone war has made the U.S. less safe, while 50% say it has made the country more secure.
One area where a majority of the public supports journalism is in the presentation of facts without interpretation, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults.

Around six-in-ten Americans (60%) say that location tracking through their cellphones would not make much of a difference in limiting the spread of the coronavirus. A smaller share (38%) believes it would help in limiting the spread of the virus.
The gap between conservative and liberal Republicans is larger than for all GOP candidates. Republican voters who identify as moderate or liberal say there is a good chance they would vote for Jeb Bush at a 2:15 percentage point, while those who identify as moderate or liberal say there is at least some chance.
There are, however, some outliers. For example, South Africans — who have been plagued by corruption in recent years — are more concerned about economic corruption than are their fellow South Africans. Meanwhile, trust in corruption is lower in Sweden than in any other country. Aloot is the least trusted country in Europe, with 48% of the public trusting others.
For the first time in at least 20 years, Republicans and Democrats have been willing to fight for their country, regardless of ideology.

In the past decade, majorities in all four groups have said it is not right to do so.
The term “living at home” is broadly applied to the American young adults who are now 25 to 35. In 2016, 15% of 25- to 35-year-olds were living at their parents’ home, versus 13% of Gen Xers, 10% of late Baby Boomers and 12% of the Silent generation.
The 9/11 attacks imprinted themselves on Americans’ psyches in a way few other events in living memory have. In an August 2011 Pew Research survey, 97% of Americans who were at least eight years old when the attacks happened said they remembered exactly where they were or what they were doing when they heard the news. The only event with that kind of recall was President Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 (95%). Other notable events, from the 1969 moon landing to Osama bin Laden’s killing, ranked well behind. In a December 2009 poll, 53% of Americans picked
One-in-five newsroom employees live in New York, Los Angeles or Washington, D.C. The financial, entertainment and political capitals of the U.S. are home to a disproportionately large share of the nation’s newsroom employees. About one-in-five newsroom employees (22%) live in these metro areas, which, by comparison, are home to 13% of all U.S. workers, according to a Center analysis of Census Bureau data covering the period from 2013 to 2017.
Republicans and Democrats differ substantially in their views of the influence of public health experts on the federal government’s policies to control the spread of the coronavirus. A majority of Millennial and older Republicans (62%) say these policies are influenced a great deal or a fair amount by public health experts, while just 14% say they are influenced at least a fair amount by these experts.
The proportion of those who interact with other people on blogs is also strongly related to how often people interact with each other. Younger, urban dwellers are more likely than older adults to read a blog about community issues, compared with older adults who are more active in blogs. By contrast, a smaller share of rural internet users (17%) read a blog about community issues in the preceding 12 months, compared with 16% of urban dwellers.
For example, in 2002, there was a strong relationship between the overall well-being index and national growth, the percentage of people who are happy with their lives and the percentage of those who are unhappy with their lives. In fact, the index was created by adding the changes on the personal front from 2002 to 2007, and the percentage of people who are happy with their lives increased by a factor of 59%. In contrast, in the other countries analyzed, the well-being index was not created by the correlation between the actual growth and the perceived changes on the personal front. This is not surprising, because the differences in
This year’s presidential elections are no longer the first in which contests over state-level seats are legal. In 1864, the first election for which the winning candidate had a popular-vote margin was less than 2 percentage points, and in 2020, the same pattern holds true today. Our analysis starts in 1824, as the first election for which statewide popular votes were both determinative and reasonably reliably reported, and continues through the remainder of the 20th century.
Online radio listening has grown in recent years, and now represents a very small but steady increase from the early years of the digital age.

Following changes in political parties is more common than it was in the summer, but there is less evidence of change since 2018. For example, among registered voters who changed parties between September 2018 and July 2020, 61% said they followed politics “most of the time,” compared with 36% who said the same about Republicans. For example, among Republicans who changed parties but not consistently in 2018 (there were some differences between those who were Republicans and Democrats, and those who switched to the Democratic Party.”
By contrast, Russians do not express much or no confidence in President Putin. Only 28% of Russians say they have a great deal or fair amount of confidence in him, while 54% express little or no confidence. In fact, about three-quarters (74%) have little or no confidence in the Russian leader.
Moms are doing more housework than dads, but there are gaps in the amount of time that dads spend with their children. In 1965, the same was true for dads, who spent more time on child care than moms, according to a Pew Research analysis of AAAS data. But the gap between dads and mothers remains large, with dads spending an average of 49.5 hours a week on child care.
A Pew post-election poll taken last weekend1 finds the voters giving Obama better grades for his conduct during the campaign than any presidential candidate since 1988. Seventy-five percent of the sample gave Obama a grade of A or B grade for his performance, while 24 percent gave him a C, D or F.
Conservative Republicans are particularly skeptical that policies can make a difference in addressing climate change. Just one-quarter of conservative Republicans say climate change policies do more good than harm for the environment, while about half (47%) say such policies make no difference for the environment and 26% think such policies do more harm than good. By contrast, a large majority of liberal Democrats (81%) say climate change policies have net benefits for the environment.

British enthusiasm for leaving the EU has been declining for years. In 2012, half of the British public said they wanted to remain in the EU, although only half said they wanted to vote in the referendum that would decide their preferred outcome.

Among Democrats with a high school diploma or less education, 62% say they agree with the Democratic Party on abortion policy, compared with just 5% of those who say they agree with the GOP.
The rise in the share of Hispanics of Mexican origin has been driven, in part, by changes in the composition of the Hispanic census population. Among the largest Hispanic origin groups, those born outside of the U.S. are Guatemalans, Colombians, Salvadorans, Cubans and Dominicans. By contrast, the share of Mexicans has declined slightly since 2000, when 33% of Hispanics were born outside of the U.S.
Half of children younger than 18 are living with a stay-at-home mother and working father. In 2014, 14% of children under 18 live with their parents in their first marriage and 14% live with a working father.

Roughly four-in-ten (39%) followed the floods in the Midwest very closely, up from 34% a week earlier. The floods were the public’s top story last week with twice as many people citing the floods as their most closely followed story than cited the presidential campaign (38% vs. 19%). By contrast, news organizations devoted somewhat more coverage to the campaign than to the flooding. Still, public interest in Midwestern flooding is far lower than it was for the region’s historic 1993 floods. In August 1993, nearly two-thirds of Americans (
Nearly seven-in-ten Americans (69%) agreed with the statement that all Americans should have the right to have medical data collected by a health care provider deleted by the organization or person who has it. But a smaller majority (56%) opposed the idea, with 41% expressing a favorable view.

A new analysis by the Pew Research Center suggests that the “richest 20%” of U.S. households actually owns 100% of all wealth, a reversal from just two years ago. But here’s a closer look at the data: The wealth gap between wealthy and poor has closed dramatically since the Great Recession, and perhaps reflects the wider trend toward greater wealth inequality.

U.S. teen pregnancy rates have fallen sharply since the 1970s, according to new Pew Research Center data. The drop in the abortion rate came during a period of rapid decline, from 43.4% per 1,000 females in 1973 to 43.4% in 2013. During this time, the overall decline in the pregnancy rate hit particularly hard among teenagers: The CDC estimated that between 37.6 and 71.6% of teen girls were pregnant during this time, compared with 71.6% of adult women. Despite the relatively high number of pregnancies in 2013, the death rate
Catholics in the U.S. are hopeful that the next pope will move in new directions, while maintaining traditional positions and keeping his traditional positions, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.

Hawaii’s racial diversity is defined by its racial and ethnic composition. In the 2013 census, the state’s racial diversity index was 22%, representing a 21-percentage-point increase from the 23% in 2006. The next highest point was Alaska, where the Hispanic share edged out the black share (10%) and the Asian share (10%).
Another high-profile aspect of America’s recent national security strategy is also widely unpopular: drones. In 39 of 44 countries surveyed, majorities or pluralities oppose U.S. drone strikes targeting extremists in countries such as Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. Moreover, opposition to drone attacks has increased in many nations since last year. Israel, the U.S. and Canada are the only nations polled where at least half of the public supports drone strikes.

Currently, 46% of Americans say it is more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns, while 58% say it is more important to control gun ownership. These opinions have changed little since early 2009.
It also emerged that a growing share of Americans dislike STEM careers and that concerns are tied to the subject. U.S. adults have a keen interest in the fields and a growing share see many young people pursuing STEM degrees because of the difficulty of the subjects. But the share of Americans who say they don’t pursue STEM degrees is higher – in both cases with four years of college experience and a lower level of education – than it is today.

The 2008 poll revealed broad acceptance of the U.S. by majorities in 40 of the 40 nations polled. But even among these elites, there was little enthusiasm for the U.S. in Europe, and even frustration with American power struggled among some. For example, 83% of Indians gave the U.S. a positive rating, but that figure fell to 71% in India at the end of the year. Similarly, about seven-in-ten in Poland (62%), Poland (61%) and Canada (45%), as well as in Britain (53%) gave the U.S

The 2010s will likely be the first decade in at least 160 years to see an increase in the average number of people living in U.S. households. This is in part because of the rising number of Americans living in multigenerational households. In 2016, a record 64 million people, or 20% of the U.S. population, lived with multiple generations under one roof, even with improvements in the U.S. economy since the Great Recession. Another factor behind the increase in household size: More Americans are “doubled up” in shared living quarters.
People in across Europe mostly support separating church and state policies. In the Netherlands, France and Ireland, a majority of adults (60%) say the government should support and support religious policies separately, while in Sweden and Finland, 80% say government policies should support and support religious policies.

The share of black and Asian college students who attend public two-year schools also increased, from 64% to 72%.
The analysis also uses a different approach that roughly places the blame for poor participation on different age groups. For example, when given the choice of age, the most likely person to participate in a party is either a person of a different education or a race, and age is chosen as the most powerful age predictor. (For more details on the analysis, see Appendix C.40.)

The survey finds that Hispanics oppose these enforcement actions, showing strong support for the criminal prosecution of employers, as well as for the criminal prosecution of embassied immigrants. In addition, they oppose the use of force in criminal cases against employers, which by a 73%-to-21% margin is considered a criminal offense.
Even though the current economic troubles are not affecting the entire world, there is considerable concern about inequality.

However, the country’s reputation among outside observers has declined since the onset of the crisis, and the Russian government resigned itself to using force in the wake of the Russian election.
The public paid less attention to the economy last week than other top stories. More than a quarter of Americans (27%) paid very close attention to reports about the condition of the U.S. economy and 15% listed this as the single news story they followed more closely than any other.

Rather than focusing on the outcome, the midterm results indicate a lack of partisanship. Indeed, the percentage of independents polling in which they believe the results will be accurate varies by region. And by region, fewer than half of those who say they think the results will be accurate – a three-point gap that spannes all but one party.
