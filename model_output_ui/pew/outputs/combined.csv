But as immigration from Latin America slows, the immigrant share among each of the nation’s Hispanic origin groups is in decline, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. This report explores data of the 14 largest Hispanic origin groups, unless otherwise noted.
The foreign-born share of Salvadorans, for example, fell from 76% in 2000 to 59% in 2013—the largest percentage point decline of any of the six largest Hispanic origin groups. Similarly, Dominicans, Guatemalans, and Colombians all had decreases of over 13 percentage points in their foreign-born shares over the same period. Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, also saw a decline, though it was only 8 percentage points since 2000. A decline is underway among smaller Hispanic origin groups, too (see Appendix Table A1). Overall, the share of the Hispanic population that is foreign born has decreased from 40% in 2000 to 35% in 2013.
Despite falling immigrant shares across all Latino origin groups, fast Latino population growth has led to continued growth in the number of Latino immigrants (though growth has slowed in recent years). Among all Latinos, there were 14.1 million immigrants in 2000. By 2005, that number reached 16.8 million, and by 2013, there were 19 million Latino immigrants in the U.S. The same pattern is present among all Latino origin groups, though for three—Ecuadorians, Mexicans and Nicaraguans—the number of immigrants has declined since 2010 (for details, see Appendix Table A2).","The share of the Hispanic origin group living in the U.S. has fallen by more than half since 2000. In 2013, 33% of the nation’s Hispanic population was born outside of the US., down from 64% a decade earlier. By comparison, the share of Hispanic origin groups living in Colombia (61%), Guatemalan (61%) and Salvadoran (60%) dropped to 57% and 60%, respectively.","The rise in the share of Hispanics of Mexican origin has been driven, in part, by changes in the composition of the Hispanic census population. Among the largest Hispanic origin groups, those born outside of the U.S. are Guatemalans, Colombians, Salvadorans, Cubans and Dominicans. By contrast, the share of Mexicans has declined slightly since 2000, when 33% of Hispanics were born outside of the U.S."

Roughly one-in-five politically engaged users (19%) indicate that they often comment, discuss or post about political issues with others on social media (just 6% of less politically engaged users post with this level of frequency). And nearly one-third of these politically engaged users feel that social media sites do “very well” at bringing new voices into the political discussion (31%) or helping people get involved with issues that matter to them (30%).
The concerns and frustrations outlined above are occurring in a broader context: namely, one in which political discussions are encroaching into a range of different social spaces. Two of the more common social media platforms – Facebook and Twitter – are illustrative in this regard. Facebook users tend to be friends primarily with people they know personally (66% of Facebook users say they mostly follow people they already know), while Twitter users are much more likely to follow people they do not know personally (48% of Twitter users indicate that most of the people they follow are in this category).

Women still lag when it comes to holding top managerial positions. And among those with a preference, both men and women say they prefer male bosses and co-workers.
Only 24 women (about 5%) currently are CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, according to an analysis by Catalyst, a nonprofit seeking to expand opportunities for women. Yet this is up from 20 female CEOs in 2013, and only one in 1998. Less than 9% of top management positions are filled by women, and the rates have declined in some key sectors in recent years. A similar analysis by Catalyst last year — this one looking at Fortune 1000 companies — found 45 women CEOs, up from 16 a decade prior, but still less than 5% of all top jobs.
Gallup has been tracking gender preferences in the workplace since 1953, when fully two-thirds of American adults (66%) said they would prefer a male boss if they had a choice in a new job. Another 25% volunteered that it made no difference, and only 5% said they would prefer a female boss. As of November 2013, the gap has narrowed but remains. A plurality (41%) say it makes no difference, but the rest prefer a male boss over a female boss by 35%-23%.","A second way of looking at the women’s role in Fortune 500 companies is by asking respondents which women they prefer to be their boss. In the most recent survey, 75% of women said they prefer a boss who is an 100% woman, compared with 48% of men. But aside from women”s experiences in the workforce, there has been a long-term increase in the preference for women as chief executives. In 2003, when the first women to take the reins in the U.S., three-in-four women CEOs were women. The increase has been driven by the rise of women CEOs","A new Pew Research Center survey examines these perceptions and patterns of leadership in organizations. For example, among the 500 companies included in the survey, three-quarters (76%) said in a 1987 Pew Research Center survey that women preferred a boss who was an “elite” woman. In the same survey, only 23% of women preferred a woman as their chief executive, compared with 48% of men. But among the 500 companies where the preference for women has changed, the share of women choosing a woman has nearly doubled since 1950."

Opinion has shifted modestly on this question: In both 2015 and 2014, more attributed a person’s wealth to greater advantages than to a stronger work ethic.
By about three-to-one (66% to 21%), Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say hard work, rather than a person’s advantages, has more to do with why someone is rich.

Democrats’ views have shown less change.
Republicans are more likely to say the reason someone is poor generally has more to do with of a lack of effort (56%) than circumstances beyond a person’s control (32%). By 71%-19%, more Democrats say that circumstances beyond one’s control are generally more often to blame for why a person is poor.

The Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project survey found that about six-in-ten Americans (59%) say they are getting campaign news online. That is up sharply from 67% in mid-October. And it is roughly the same percentage as in November of last year, when we first began asking about the issue.","The NSA’s digital push has been stalled in the partisan realm, with the vast majority of Americans now saying they can get news about the campaign online. As of mid-October 2000, just 15% of Americans were getting campaign news online, up from 17% in early October."

Meanwhile, in Uganda, Kenya and Senegal – among the poorest countries surveyed – half or more say food for their family has been hard to come by.
The United States is a clear outlier from this pattern. Despite being the richest country in the survey, nearly a quarter of Americans (24%) say they had trouble putting food on the table in the past 12 months. This reported level of deprivation is closer to that in Indonesia or Greece rather than Britain or Canada.","A similar trend emerges when looking at the indicators of deprivation.

Somewhat fewer say Uganda has the highest per capita income of any developing country.","But a new Pew Research Center analysis of data from the International Monetary Fund suggests that many in Developing countries struggle to avert food shortages. The correlation is strongest in Kenya, where 0.7 percentage points are given for each of the 10 emerging markets.

Fully 61% believe the Smith story has been overcovered, far more than the number saying that about any other recent story. Even so, a sizable minority (11%) followed Smith’s death more closely than any of last week’s other top stories. This is on par with the number who cited news about the 2008 presidential candidates (13%) or the Super Bowl (11%) as the stories they followed most closely. The war in Iraq was the top story for the week of Feb. 5, with 30% following it most closely.
Data collected since the start of the year suggest that the public and the press are often in agreement about the most important news stories of the day. The Iraq war has consistently been the top-ranked news story both in terms of public interest and press coverage. In the News Interest Index survey for the week of Feb. 5 (conducted Feb. 9-12), 30% of Americans said the situation in Iraq was the story they followed most closely, nearly double the next highest story – winter weather. During that same week, 22% of the news reported across a broad spectrum of media outlets was devoted to the Iraq war (12% to the policy debate and 10% to events on the ground), according to PEJ.
The death of Anna Nicole Smith, which set off a classic media feeding frenzy, may be an instance where press coverage exceeded public demand. Eleven percent of the public said Smith’s death was the news story they followed most closely last week; 9% of the week’s news coverage was devoted to this topic. But because the death occurred mid-week, the full extent of news coverage is not accurately captured by that 9% figure. In the two days immediately following Smith’s death (Feb. 8-9), nearly a quarter of the news from all sectors (24%) was devoted to this story, and fully half of cable news was focused on Smith. The public reacted negatively to the abundance of coverage – 61% feel that the Smith story received too much coverage, compared with just 8% who think it should have received more.
It seems that news coverage of the weather did not match the public’s fascination with it. Record cold temperatures and dramatic snowstorms captured the interest of many Americans this past week – 17% said the weather was their top story, while only 3% of the news coverage was devoted to this topic.","Other major stories of the week included the Iraq war, the winter weather, the presidential campaign, and events on the ground in Iraq. Roughly a third of the public (32%) followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely, and 22% listed Iraq as their most closely followed story.","Public interest in the Iraq war remained high last week as the country marked the fourth anniversary of the conflict, and the Winter Olympics took a toll on both sides of the Atlantic. In a week in which the national news media devoted 7% of its overall coverage to the winter weather, 3% of the public followed news about winter weather very closely and 8% listed this as their most closely followed story of the week. The national news media devoted 1% of its overall coverage to the story."

But the lead up to the invasion of Iraq produced a typical rally around the president in times of foreign crisis that kept Bush’s approval ratings quite healthy. America’s quick and relatively painless Gulf War victory sent his approval scores to record highs in the first quarter of 1991 obviating the political impact of a steady rise in unemployment … but not for long. Over the course of the remainder of the year, Bush’s approval rating tumbled, falling from a high of 86% in March to 50% in December. Over that period, the unemployment rate rose from 6.4% to 7.3%.
For much of Clinton’s first term, unemployment rates and public judgments of the president were not in close correspondence. Unemployment declined from above 7% at the time he took office to 5.5% by the end of 1994. However, Clinton’s ratings were quite mixed for much of this time reflecting political difficulties (the collapse of health care reform, and bitter fights over his crime bill and economic packages), as well as controversies over his past personal and financial involvements. However, Clinton’s ratings began to improve in the fall of 1995 as a result of a successful showdown with Newt Gingrich over a shutdown of the federal government. Unemployment remained low in 1996, and Clinton’s ratings rose.","Unemployment declined during George H.W. Bush’s second term in office.

And though online ad revenues continue to soar, they currently account for just five percent of all newspaper company revenue. In addition to sluggish ad growth, newspapers are challenged by circulation declines, a skeptical Wall Street, ownership changes — such as Knight Ridder’s recent sale of its 32 papers — and perhaps most notably, adapting to the world of online news. In this, the third of the Pew Project for Excellence in Journalism roundtables on the future of the news media, six experts from inside the newspaper industry discuss its future, its fate, and the changes it must make to survive.

In its annual survey, BJS asks crime victims whether they reported their crime to police or not. In 2019, only 40.9% of violent crimes and 32.5% of household property crimes were reported to authorities. BJS notes that there are a variety of reasons why crime might not be reported, including fear of reprisal or “getting the offender in trouble,” a feeling that police “would not or could not do anything to help,” or a belief that the crime is “a personal issue or too trivial to report.”
Most of the crimes that are reported to police, meanwhile, are not solved, at least based on an FBI measure known as the clearance rate. That’s the share of cases each year that are closed, or “cleared,” through the arrest, charging and referral of a suspect for prosecution, or due to “exceptional” circumstances such as the death of a suspect or a victim’s refusal to cooperate with a prosecution. In 2019, police nationwide cleared 45.5% of violent crimes that were reported to them and 17.2% of the property crimes that came to their attention.","Only about half of the violent crimes and a third of the property crimes that occur in the United States each year are reported to police.

For our analysis, we used the IPUMS-CPS dataset, drawn from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, a supplemental portion of which asks people about their incomes as well as their occupations, making estimation possible. (We didn’t attempt to model how employers might respond to the new rules.)
By our estimates, last year just under 4.9 million workers would have become newly eligible for overtime pay had the rule been in place. That’s somewhat more than the Labor Department’s estimate of 4.65 million, though they used pooled 2011-13 data and a more detailed methodology. (Other estimates of the number of affected workers range from 3 million, by the American Action Forum, to 5.9 million, by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research.)
Although the 4.9 million employees in our estimate worked in more than 150 separately defined occupations, just 14 occupations accounted for more than half the estimated impact. Those range from the to-be-expected (retail, food service and office managers of various sorts) to the somewhat surprising (designers, accountants and auditors).","How Overtime-related job losses have affected the American workforce?

Media  | ""State ofthe Kagan. News Media 2016""  | PEW RESEARCH CENTER ",pew/dataset/imgs/multi_col-3833.png,"Driven in part by a highly competitive presidential primary season, cable news saw its viewership jump 8%, to an average of 3.1 million viewers in prime time (according to Pew Research Center analysis of Nielsen Media Research data, used under license). This was especially pronounced at CNN, whose prime-time audience grew 38%. Cable channels gained economically as well, with annual revenue for the three major channels (Fox News Channel, CNN and MSNBC) projected to rise 10%, to $4 billion.
Podcasting continues to experience audience growth – though this includes both those podcasts focused on news and those looking at other subjects. About one-in-five U.S. adults ages 12 or older (21%) listened to some kind of podcast in the past month, up from 12% six years ago, and 36% have ever listened to a podcast, up from 23% in 2010. Though the audience (and revenue) for podcasts is only a small portion of that for radio, streaming radio has been growing as well, with the share who listened to online radio (whether news or non-news) in the past month more than doubling since 2010, from 27% to 57%. This growth hasn’t necessarily cannibalized the audience for traditional radio, however; 91% of those ages 12 and older listened to terrestrial radio in the past month. When it comes to news radio in particular, NPR’s flagship news programs each have around 12 million listeners. (This is roughly half of the average viewership of the three nightly TV network newscasts, which together attracted about 24 million viewers in 2015.)","Fox News, CNN, MSNBC and Bloomberg are estimated to bring in $5 billion in revenue in their Securities and Exchange Commission filings this year.

Those actions earn Egypt an overall score of 8.9 out of 10 on the 2011 Government Restrictions Index — a scale developed by Pew Research to gauge government restrictions on religion in nearly 200 countries and territories over time. That’s much higher than Middle Eastern-North African countries as a whole, where the median index score (including Egypt’s) is 5.9.","Government restrictions include not only national laws and policies, but also actions by local governments and officials, which we find account for a sizeable portion of the country’s overall restrictions on religion. In a new Pew Research Center survey, 50% of Egyptians say they are at least somewhat restrictive toward religious groups, including Christians and Muslims. Seventy percent of Christians and 60% of Muslims say their government is restrictive.

By 2055, the U.S. will not have a single racial or ethnic majority. Much of this change has been (and will be) driven by immigration. Nearly 59 million immigrants have arrived in the U.S. in the past 50 years, mostly from Latin America and Asia. Today, a near-record 14% of the country’s population is foreign born compared with just 5% in 1965. Over the next five decades, the majority of U.S. population growth is projected to be linked to new Asian and Hispanic immigration. American attitudes about immigration and diversity are supportive of these changes for the most part. More Americans say immigrants strengthen the country than say they burden it, and most say the U.S.’s increasing ethnic diversity makes it a better place to live.
Asia has replaced Latin America (including Mexico) as the biggest source of new immigrants to the U.S. In a reversal of one of the largest mass migrations in modern history, net migration flows from Mexico to the U.S. turned negative between 2009 and 2014, as more Mexicans went home than arrived in the U.S. And after rising steadily since 1990, the unauthorized immigrant population has leveled off in recent years, falling to 11.3 million in 2014 from a high of 12.2 million in 2007. Meanwhile, Asians are now the only major racial or ethnic group whose numbers are rising mainly because of immigration. And while African immigrants make up a small share of the U.S. immigrant population, their numbers are also growing steadily – roughly doubling every decade since 1970.","Since 1965, the number of U.S. immigrants living in this country has surpassed that of their total population, according to new Pew Research Center projections based on 2015 data. However, the growth rate of the Asian-Pacific Islander population is projected to continue gradually through at least 20 years. In 2015, 38% of immigrants were from Asian countries, while by 2065 that share will have surpassed it.","Since 1965, the share of the immigrant population that is white has risen from 11% to 31%.

Still, while New Zealand’s GRI score has been low since we first began measuring it in 2007, it did tick upwards slightly in 2016. This recent increase is due in part to derogatory statements made by Winston Peters, leader of the New Zealand First Party, when he said in June 2016 that certain countries “treat their women like cattle,” and suggested that all immigrants should be screened for unacceptable attitudes before being permitted to enter the country. Some media reports said he specifically referred to Muslim immigrants, which he denied.
New Zealand had “low” levels of social hostilities involving religion in 2016 (with a Social Hostilities Index score of 0.9 out of 10). There have been incidents of religiously motivated violence and hostilities in the past, although these cases have been relatively rare. In September 2016, for example, the Whanganui branch of the Right Wing Resistance, a right wing organization, circulated pamphlets that accused Muslim refugees in the country of intending to change the culture of New Zealand to suit themselves and to “kill anyone” who did not believe in God.","New Zealand has experienced “mostly” low levels of religion-related social hostilities in the past decade, according to the same Pew Research Center study.

Polygamy is widespread in a cluster of countries in West and Central Africa, including Burkina Faso, (36%), Mali (34%) and Nigeria (28%). In these countries, polygamy is legal, at least to some extent. Muslims in Africa are more likely than Christians to live in this type of arrangement (25% vs. 3%), but in some countries, the practice also is widespread among adherents of folk religions and people who do not identify with a religion. For example, in Burkina Faso, 45% of people who practice folk religions, 40% of Muslims and 24% of Christians live in polygamous households. Chad is the only country in this analysis where Christians (21%) are more likely than Muslims (10%) to live in this type of arrangement.
Religion often plays a role in how polygamy is governed and practiced within a single country. In Nigeria, for example, polygamous marriage is not allowed at the federal level, but the prohibition only applies to civil marriages. Twelve northern, Muslim-majority states do recognize these unions as Islamic or customary marriages. In India, Muslim men are allowed to marry multiple women, while men of other groups are not. However, in countries where polygamy is common, it often is practiced by people of all faiths. That’s the case in Gambia, Niger, Mali, Chad and Burkina Faso, where at least one-in-ten people in every religious group measured live in households that include husbands with more than one spouse.","In Burkina Faso, which is home to a large share of the world’s population, a plurality of people live in polygamous households, including roughly a quarter (24%) of Christians, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of survey data.","In nine African countries, as well as in Burkina Faso and Mali, around three-in-ten or more Africans live in polygamous households, with about a third (36%) of the population being Muslim and one-third (40%) being unaffiliated. By contrast, in only one country, Cameroon, which has the largest Muslim population and the largest Christian population, about a quarter (23%) of adults live in polygamous households."

That’s the case whether you look at presidential, House or Senate elections.
Last year’s midterm Senate election was the costliest ever – or at least since 1974, when modern disclosure rules kicked in. The 2014 election featured several competitive races, the outcomes of which would determine control of the Senate; Democrats and Republicans fought – and spent – fiercely. According to our analysis of Campaign Finance Institute data, nearly $1.1 billion was spent on 2014’s Senate races by candidates, parties and outside groups, 25% more than in the previous off-year cycle of 2010. The biggest increase was in non-party independent expenditures, which soared from $105.6 million (inflation-adjusted) to $387.3 million.
But despite all that money and attention, voter turnout in last year’s Senate elections didn’t increase; in fact, it was the lowest since 1990. We calculated turnout using estimates of the voting-eligible population (all citizens of voting age, at home and abroad, excepting ineligible felons) made by University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald. Only about 44 million people voted for Senate in 2014, according to tabulations published by the House Clerk’s office – 38% of the voting-eligible population in those states with Senate elections.","But while the overall turnout rate in House and Senate elections typically lags that in midterm elections, so too has spending on congressional campaigns. In 2014, for example, the House voters cast 87 million votes, compared with just 59,000 in the Senate elections. Total votes cast in congressional elections typically rise or fall over the same period.","Turnout in the 2014 midterm elections is still relatively high – at 0.2 percent, but it’s still higher than in 2008. But as in 2008, a new Pew Research Center analysis finds that more than two-thirds of the total votes cast in the 2014 Senate and House elections were at least twice as many votes as in the 2008 and 2010 midterms."

By far, age was the most important predictor of intention to participate, all other things being equal. But party affiliation, education and income also were significant predictors in the analysis. Race, ethnicity and gender were not significantly related to intended participation in the census, after controlling for other demographic characteristics.
Younger Americans are less likely than older people to say they definitely will participate, even when controlling for other demographic characteristics. For those younger than 30, the probability of saying they will definitely fill out the census form is .40, compared with a probability of .75 for those 50 and older when all other variables are held constant at their mean. There also is a partisan divide in intention to participate; all other things being equal, the probability of Democrats saying they definitely will participate is .75 while the probability for Republicans is .56.","In this analysis, among the most powerful predictor for future participation, the oldest adults (people ages 50 and older) are the most likely to actually participate in the Republican Party. The oldest adults are more likely to participate than the youngest adults. As shown in the previous report, those older tend to outpace older adults in terms of participation rate. They are also more active at a rate of 1.8 percentage points per 1.1 points regardless of gender.","The analysis also uses a different approach that roughly places the blame for poor participation on different age groups. For example, when given the choice of age, the most likely person to participate in a party is either a person of a different education or a race, and age is chosen as the most powerful age predictor.

But politically divided delegations became more common in the 1960s and ’70s as decades-old patterns of state-level party dominance began to break down. By the 96th Congress of 1979-80, more than half the states (27) had split delegations, and from 1969 through 1994 more than 20 states sent split delegations to the Senate. Since then, despite some ups and downs, the trend has been toward more single-party delegations. As of now, 19 states have two Republican senators and 17 have two Democrats.","For the first session of the 115th Congress, members of both parties will be voting in the Senate. Split senators are a new phenomenon, with members ranging from 43 Republicans and 39 Democrats to 42 Republicans. There are about 20 senators, of whom 21 are Democrats and 21 are Republicans (and 14 are independents).","Although the 114th Congress now comprises 16 members, there are 17 members of each party, a slight increase from the previous Congress, which ran twice as often as the 114th (because it had only one senator and two members). In both states, split delegations have fallen 18 percentage points each. This is especially the case for the 115th Congress, which ran two sessions at once and then switched to one session each."

The Pew Research Center survey, conducted May 25 to June 29, 2016, with a nationally representative sample of 5,006 adults, suggests that the broad economic concerns of rural white Americans align to a striking degree with several key issues that were among the cornerstones of the Trump campaign: jobs, immigrants and fears about an eroding standard of living. Moreover, these anxieties are more deeply felt among rural whites than among whites in the cities or suburbs. Among the issues:","Rural whites are more concerned about jobs, working immigrants and children’s future than other whites.

The survey also examined public school prayer from a different angle by asking teens whether they see other students praying before eating lunch.

Teens who identify with a religion are more likely than those who self-identify as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” to notice this (19% vs. 9%).
Prayer in a school setting doesn’t just take place before lunch and, in fact, teens in public school are more likely to see students praying before sporting events (39%) than before lunch, according to the survey. Again, there are differences in these answers across religious groups: About half of evangelical Protestant teens (55%) and mainline Protestant teens (52%) say they commonly see other students praying before sporting events, as do 42% of Catholic teens.

A Pew Research Center report released today looks specifically at the political news habits of Millennials, and how they vary from the two generations before them. Here are five key takeaways from the report:
Millennials rely on Facebook for their news far more than any other source. About six-in-ten online Millennials (61%) report getting political news on Facebook in a given week. Baby Boomers’ political media habits, on the other hand, are strongly rooted in local TV: A majority of them (60%) say they turn there for political news. Millennials’ relatively low reliance on local TV (37% watch political news there in a given week) almost mirrors Baby Boomers’ low reliance on Facebook (39%). Gen Xers bridge the gap, with about equal portions of online adults in this generation getting political news from Facebook (51%) and local TV (46%).","For news about politics and government, social media may be for the Millennial generation what local TV is for the Baby Boomer generation. Six-in-ten (61%) online Millennials say they get political news on Facebook in a given week, a much larger percentage than any other source for news.

These trends also reflect a major shift taking place in the news world, as social networking sites increasingly become an integral part of Americans’ news experience.","For news about politics and government, social media may be for the Millennial generation what local TV is for the Baby Boomer generation.

But the government, both directly and through state-owned enterprises, was still the source of more than three-quarters of Cuba’s economic activity. Government investment represented just 9.1% of GDP in 2012, versus 14.2% in 1989, which Hernandez-Cata said “reveals one of the most disturbing aspects of Cuba’s recent economic history: the weakness of capital formation.” (Official government figures put economy-wide fixed capital investment, from all sources, at 8.3% of GDP in 2013, considered low by international standards.)","Despite these sweeping changes, most Cubans still work for the state. According to the data from the Oficina Nacional de Estadistica (ANNE), more than 74% of Cubans work in the public sector, similar to the 74% who said the same in 2013.

This refugee flow continues today, with nearly 9,000 refugees from Somalia entering the U.S. in fiscal 2015.

Viewership climbed 6% in the morning (5 to 7 a.m.) and 3% in the early evening (5 to 7 p.m.) newscasts, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis. The audience barely edged up—by .1%—in the late night slot (11 p.m.), a newscast that had suffered the biggest decreases in recent years.
The good news comes after a difficult 2012 when late night and early evening audiences each dropped by 7% and the morning audience decreased by 5%. Indeed, viewership for all three slots had declined every year from 2008-2012—with the exception of a small uptick in 2011. Pew Research analyzes Nielsen Media Research audience data for all four major sweeps periods — February, May, July and November — and computes national averages for each time slot.
The jump in viewership in the key timeslots was due largely to significant increases in the November sweeps period when morning news was up 12%, early evening grew by 8% and late night increased by 6%. While it is impossible to know whether the 2013 numbers are a harbinger of a new spurt of audience growth, they coincide with a wave of consolidation that has seen bullish media companies—from Gannett to Tribune—buy up large groups of stations.
While the 2013 numbers are encouraging, the overall trend in local television news audience has not been positive. Even including 2013, the morning newscasts—the most consistent viewership performer in local news—has lost 3% of its audience since 2007. The decrease from 2007-2013 in early evening news viewership has been more dramatic—12%. And overall, the late night newscasts have lost about one-sixth of their viewers (17%) in that time period.","Bucking a long-range trend of declining viewership, the audience for local TV news grew in all three major time slots in 2013. In the late night slot (11 p.m. to 2 a.m.) newscasts, 20% of voters said they had tuned in to local news. This audience barely edged up—by.5%—in the early evening slot (5 a. m.), a newscast that had suffered the biggest decreases in recent years.","A new Pew Research Center analysis examines the audience dynamics for a host of local television news channels, including AM, noon and early evening news, which has a much lower audience than the three major cable channels that air on NBC. The audience reached a new high in the morning slot (11 p.m. to 2 a.m.), a figure that has nearly doubled since 2007."

Our June survey found, the number of unemployed people fell by more than half since the start of the recession (from 9.9 million in January 2007 to 9.3 million in June 2009), falling from a peak of 12.2% in January 2008 to 5.7% in the current recession.","However, that “official” unemployment rate in the U.S. was 5.7% in January, which was roughly the same as in December 2009 (which was also known as the “official” unemployment rate).

In fact, the story evokes a typical response from the public when compared with news interest in past Washington scandals. Amid calls for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales’ resignation, the news media’s coverage of the story outstripped public interest. Most Americans remained focused on the Iraq war and the problems facing returning soldiers.
Overall, 19% of the public paid very close attention to news about the fired U.S. attorneys and 8% said this was the single news story they followed more closely than any other. The news media devoted 16% of its coverage overall to the firings – an eight-fold increase over the week of March 5 – making it the most covered story of the week. Public interest increased as well though at a lower rate. Democrats followed the U.S. attorneys story more closely than Republicans (23% vs. 15%, respectively, followed it very closely).This story did generate more public interest than the recent verdict in the Scooter Libby trial – one of last week’s most covered news stories. Only 13% followed that story very closely.
While the news media focused on how Gonzales and the White House were connected to the U.S. attorney firings, the public remained intensely focused on the Iraq War. Fully 34% said they followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely and 23% listed Iraq as the story they followed most closely last week.

In the Netherlands, those who view the right-wing Party for Freedom favorably are 17 percentage points more likely to say they prefer having strong economic ties with Moscow to being tough with Russia on foreign policy disputes; in the UK, the difference between the competing views is an even wider 21 points.",Those with a favorable opinion of right-wing populist parties in Europe are more likely than those with unfavorable views to prioritize having a strong economic relationship with Russia over having a tough with Russia on foreign policy disputes. Roughly three-quarters (72%) of those who have a positive opinion of the Alternative for Germany party (AfD) say a strong relationship is more important. This compares with 56% among the rest of the French public.,"Those who have a favorable opinion of right-wing populist parties in Germany and Italy are much more likely than those who have an unfavorable opinion of these parties to prefer a strong economic relationship with Russia. That is especially true of the two right-wing populist parties, which have been in close contact with Russia since the establishment of the United States in 1935. The exception is the case among Sweden Democrats, which has been in close contact with Russia since the establishment of the United Kingdom in 1935."

The Project first began surveying teenagers about their mobile phones in its 2004 Teens and Parents project when a survey showed that 45% of teens had a cell phone. Since that time, mobile phone use has climbed steadily among teens ages 12 to 17 – to 63% in fall of 2006 and then to 71% in early 2008.
Among teens, age is the most important variable in mobile phone ownership. Older teens are much more likely to own phones than younger teens, and the largest increase occurs at age 14, right at the transition between middle and high school. Among 12-13 year olds, 52% had a cell phone in 2008. Mobile phone ownership jumped to 72% at age 14 in that survey, and by the age of 17 more than eight in ten teens (84%) had their own cell phone.","Landline phones do not show these differences in ownership by age – older and younger teens are more likely to own them than their younger counterparts. If anything, landline phone ownership shows a slight increase since 2004-2008, when 82% of 12-year-olds and 59% of 18- to 29-year.-olds owned a landline device. Face to face, in other words, the larger frequency of ownership among cell phone owners between ages 18 and 17 is a little higher today than it was in 2004/2008.","The trend is mostly driven by a growing number of teen cell phone owners. In 2008, 64% of teen cell phone owners were ages 12 or younger, making them slightly more likely than the 43% of adults who owned them in 2004 and 2008, respectively. Among other factors, cell phone ownership among boys has increased more modestly, from 37% in 2004 to 43% in 2008 and 43% in 2008. For more on cell ownership by age, see the Pew Internet Project report “Getting Started with Teens,” released Feb. 14, 2008."

In fact, two of the most used hashtags around social causes in Twitter history focus on race and criminal justice: #Ferguson and #BlackLivesMatter. In addition to social and political issues, social media also serve as places where conversations about race intersect with a number of issues, including pop culture, sports and everyday personal experiences.
A new Pew Research Center survey finds significant differences in the way black and white adults use social media to share and interact with race-related content1 And a Pew Research Center analysis of tweets reveals that key news events – from Baltimore, to Charleston, South Carolina, to Dallas – often serve as a catalyst for social media conversations about race.

Mothers in these families see it differently: Many say they are doing more when it comes to these tasks.
For example, in families with two full-time working parents overall, 59% of parents overall say they and their partners share household chores about equally, while 31% say the mother does more and 9% say the father does. Moms, however, are twice as likely as dads to say they handle more of these tasks. For their part, most dads see a more even division of household chores: 64% say they and their partner share this about equally.
While it’s hard to say whose account is the most accurate when it comes to how parenting and household responsibilities are shared, an analysis of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data provides a glimpse into how full-time working moms and dads spend their time. This analysis shows that while full-time working moms spend more time than full-time working dads on parenting and household tasks, the difference is modest. For example, mothers who work full time spend an average of 11.9 hours per week, or 1.7 hours per day, on housework, compared with 1.2 hours per day among fathers who work full time.","Whether or not both parents are working full time is a mothers’ issue.

Hispanics continue to punch below their weight. Much was made right after the November election about the clout of the Hispanic vote (by, among others, the Pew Research Center).

Generally, Americans appreciate lots of information and access to it.","When it comes to their confidence in their ability to use digital devices to meet information demands, most Americans say these statements describe them very well (81%) or somewhat well (61%). And about six-in-ten (61%) say having a lot of information makes them feel like they have more control over things in their life.","Fully 81% of Americans say the statements “I have a lot of information in my life makes me feel like I have more control over things in my life” describe them very well. And seven-in-ten say the same about “having a lot of information makes me feel like – having more control over things in my life” (79%) and “most of the time, it is easy for me to determine what is trustworthy.”"
