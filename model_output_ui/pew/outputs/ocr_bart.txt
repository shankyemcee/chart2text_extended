On the other hand, a majority of white congregants (57%) say the current operating status of their congregation should be unchanged, with just 5% saying it should be closed with modifications.
India lags other EU nations in annual inflation, but that’s not the case everywhere. The average annual inflation rate in the steuro fare region was 2.0% in October, compared with 0.2% in the European Union.

A median of 51% expect relations to stay about the same, while only 27% say they will get worse. The share expecting relations to worsen is lowest in Africa and the Middle East.
How do social media users discover news? Facebook is an important source of website referrals for many news outlets, but the users who arrive via Facebook spend far less time and consume far fewer pages than those who arrive directly. The same is true of users arriving by search. Our analysis of comScore data found visitors who go to a news media website directly spend roughly three times as long as those who wind up there through search or Facebook, and they view roughly five times as many pages per month. This higher level of engagement from direct visitors is evident whether a site’s traffic is driven by search or social sharing and it has

Roughly seven-in-ten Americans (71%) also say they do not have confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs – a high since the Center first asked the question in 2014.
Climate change is not viewed as a distant threat. Across the nations surveyed, a median of 51% believe people are already being harmed by climate change and another 28% think people will be harmed in the next few years.

For example, 50% of Lebanese said in a 2014 survey that they were at least somewhat concerned about Iran, compared with 16% who said the same in 2010. Concerns about Iran had fallen in Canada and Mexico since then, although they remain relatively stable in the U.S. and Mexico.

If confirmed, Gorsuch, who currently serves on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Colorado, would join at least 70 others with prior experience as judges. Of these, at least 30 also came from U.A. appellate courts. And like the vast majority of Supreme Court justices – 105 so far – Gorsuch would bring private practice experience to the court. While less common, Gorsuch’s previous role as principal deputy to the associate attorney general puts him in line with at least 23 justices who served in the U.N. Department of Justice.
Many more Americans say it is better for a woman to have children before she’s entering the office (51%) than to have them early in her career (23%).

In the poorer nations, however, there was a double-digit rise in income, from 65% to 65%. The global financial crisis was not well-documented, however. As a result, the income gap between the rich and the poor more than doubled from 2008 to 2009.

In a new Pew Research Center survey, 50% of Egyptians say they are at least somewhat restrictive toward religious groups, including Christians and Muslims. Seventy percent of Christians and 60% of Muslims say their government is restrictive. At the same time, religious restrictions are much more prevalent in the Asia-Pacific and sub-Saharan Africa regions than in the Middle East and North Africa.
Landline phones do not show these differences in ownership by age – older and younger teens are more likely to own them than their younger counterparts. If anything, landline phone ownership shows a slight increase since 2004-2008, when 82% of 12-year-olds and 59% of 18- to 29-year.-olds owned a landline device. Face to face, in other words, the larger frequency of ownership among cell phone owners between ages 18 and 17 is a little higher today than it was in 2004/2008.

Majorities of Indian adults are concerned about exposure to false or incorrect information on their mobile phones. Applying this technique to mobile phones can depress the number of infections dramatically if those who use it are quarantined and contacts and apps are not used. However, mobile phone owners are more likely to say they are at least somewhat concerned about this type of misinformation spreading on their phones than are mobile owners. In a September 2018 survey, majority of mobile owners in India said they are both somewhat concerned (51%) and concerned (45%) about mobile ownership. Parents and minor children were more likely than their elders to express concern about this

As was the case in 2009, a plurality of the public (82%) say they would continue to use their favorite site if there was a pay wall. Would that make them go further and find other platforms that were not built to support the wall? At the same time, a smaller minority (15%) says they would not continue to Use their sites if they had the opportunity. These findings are consistent with other surveys showing that those who have a favorable view of the Pew Internet Project have consistently expressed support for the wall.

A similar share of Americans with a bachelor’s degree or higher (43%) say they have ever used fertility treatments to try to have a baby, but this share is particularly high among those with a high school diploma or less. College-educated women are more likely than those with some college experience to say they or someone they know has done this (56% vs. 43%).
A median of 63% across the 38 countries surveyed agree that most people are better off in a free market economy. Roughly three-in-ten hold this view in South Korea (78%), Germany (73%), the U.S. (70%) and Israel (68%).
The public’s preferences for the overall size of government are little changed in recent years. Currently, 47% say they would rather have a smaller government providing fewer services; 44% prefer a bigger government providing more services.
The share of voters who support or lean toward Biden who express a preference for voting in person is smaller than the share who prefer to cast their ballots in person on Election Day (39%). However, Black voters are more likely than White voters to prefer to vote in person (37% vs. 18%).
While the public followed news about the economy more closely than any other story last week, the ongoing rollout of the 2010 health care law was the public’s top story.
Germans’ and Germans’ views of their own economies are now more positive than they have been in the past. Over the past three years, the overall unemployment rate has fallen by 6.2% and is now at its lowest point in more than a decade.
Younger girls are more likely than their male counterparts to have unfriended or blocked photos of themselves and a former partner on social media. Some 46% of girls ages 13 to 17 have done this, compared with 31% of boys.
Currently, 51% of voters in this age group affiliate with the Democratic Party or lean Democratic compared with 39% who describe themselves as Republicans or lean toward the GOP. Thus voters in Gen X and the latter part of the Baby Boom — the most Republican age cohort four years ago — now are about as Democratic as are older age groups, the early Baby Boomers and the so-called Silent Generation.
When it comes to Obama’s place in history, a majority of Americans (58%) say history will judge him above average or outstanding; just 16% say he’ll be below average or poor. Views are about the same as for George W. Bush at the end of his term (32% above average, 28% below average).
The number of Mexicans in the U.S. illegally has declined by 625,000 in recent years, from 6.9 million in 2007 to 6 million in 2012, according to new Pew Research Center estimates based on government data. However, the decline in the unauthorized population stems mainly from a decrease in the average annual inflow of Mexicans.
The Pew Hispanic Center projections have assumed that the annual growth rate of school-age children will rise to 166% between 2010 and 2050, mainly because of a rapid growth in the non-Hispanic Hispanic population. This is projected to reach 166% in 2050. The Census Bureau projections have not specified how the Hispanic rate will grow to 67% from 67% in 2006.
Support for the death penalty in the U.S. has ticked up recently, but is far lower than it was two decades ago. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in April and May 2018 found that 54% of Americans favor the death death penalty for people convicted of murder, while 39% oppose it. That was up from 2016, when 49% said they favored capital punishment, compared with 42% who opposed it. But it was lower than in 1996, when 78% of U.N. adults supported capital punishment.
Two years ago, a 57% majority of Republicans said Trump had a responsibility to reduce his tax returns. Today, that share has fallen to 28%. Among Democrats, there has been a modest increase in the share saying Trump does this (28% vs. 28%).

A new national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted April 23-27 among 1,504 adults, finds that public views of the Supreme Court are as positive as they have been since the question was first asked in 2007.
Such analyses, though, rely on projections of how many same-sex couples will want to marry. In the Pew Research Center’s recent survey of LGBT Americans, similar percentages of unmarried gays and lesbians (56% and 58%, respectively) said they would like to get married someday; 4% of gay men and 6% of lesbians said they were currently legally married (the report did not attempt to estimate the total LGBT population).
Suburban residents and rural residents are more divided than others on whether people in each community have values that are similar to or different from their own. Some 46% of suburban residents say most people in suburban areas have values similar to their own, while 58% say people in rural areas do not.
For the first time in more than four decades of Pew Research Center surveys, mothers’ views of their own gender and leadership have been more positive than negative. The survey found that 54% of women say their mothers are better off, while 39% say their leaders are the same as they were four years ago. About four-in-ten (42%) say women are doing better, up from 40% in 2007.
Tuesday night’s botched execution of Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett is renewing debate about how, and whether, the U.S. should continue to impose the death penalty. Though a majority (59%) of those convicted of murder say they favor the death Penalty, that is the lowest support level in four decades; support has been falling for the past two decades. In the most recent Pew Research Center survey, conducted Nov. 9-14, 2011, 60% of Americans said they favored, while 38% opposed.
A new Pew Research Center survey finds that those who have been harassed online are more likely to turn to others for support in their aftermath of an incident. Roughly half of U.S. adults (55%) say they have experienced support or support after their most recent incident from someone known to them, while 16% have received support from friends or family members. About one-in-five Americans (16%) say it has been difficult for them to go online.
Millennials are as politically divided as earlier generations were in their early generations. For example, in the early 1980s, roughly six-in-ten Gen Xers (61%) said they were middle class. But today, as they are younger and more diverse, a larger share of Millennials identify as Democrats or lean Democratic. As might be expected, they are more politically engaged than earlier generations by some measures of social networking.
The number of people moving to the U.S. from Mexico has fallen sharply in recent years. According to new Pew Research Center estimates, there were about 1.370,000 migrants from Mexico in the five years from February 1995 to August 2014, down from more than 1 million in 2007. At the same time, the number of unauthorized Mexican immigrants returning home has risen.

People in both the U.S. and Canada have grown increasingly negative in their views of China. Roughly two-thirds in Canada (65%) now say they have an unfavorable opinion of the country – the highest percentage in any country since Pew Research Center began polling in 2005. Canada stands out as the first country in which a majority (54%) now see China negatively. Americans, on the other hand, are more divided: 45% unfavorable, 47% favorable, and 60% unfavorable. The share of Canadians who see China favorably has increased in both countries since the question was first asked in 2013.
The rise of online streaming services such as Netflix and HBO Go has dramatically altered the media habits of Americans, especially young adults.
Among those who say senior members of Trump administration definitely or probably have improper contact with Russia during the 2016 campaign, nearly three-quarters (74%) say they are at least somewhat confident that the special counsel will conduct a fair investigation into Russian involvement. Three-in-ten (30%) say the investigation is not too (25%) or not at all (16%) confident in the Mueller’s ability to investigate this issue.
The percentage of Muslims who identify as Muslim ranges from 69% in Britain to 71% in Turkey. In Indonesia, Turkey, and Jordan, about two-thirds or more of the population say they consider themselves Muslim. The majority of British Muslims (81%) say they think of themselves as Muslim, as do roughly half of French Muslims (66%).
The economy and jobs: Americans’ views of economic conditions are more positive than they have been in recent years. An October survey found 41% of Americans rating economic conditions in the country as “excellent” or “good,” near the highest point in a decade. The public’s improving economic outlook is reflected in its policy agenda for Trump and Congress in the coming year. Economic issues – improving the job situation, strengthening the economy and reducing the budget deficit – are now viewed as less important policy priorities than they were just a few years ago, according to a survey conducted earlier this month.
In a 2012 survey by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project, 50% of Facebook users said that the platform has become more important to them in the past year. Women (74%) were more likely than men (22%) to say this. The survey found that Facebook use increased time for women and men – from 9% of men to 16% of women.
Gun violence has long plagued American society. But it has not always been the case. Americans who grew up in rural areas are more likely than those who have suburban or urban areas to say there were guns in their household when they were growing up.
The public’s interest in news from Iraq and Afghanistan remained high last week as 27% cited this as their top story of the week. Another 19% say they followed news about Afghanistan very closely.

The public expresses clear support for the U.S. policy of never paying ransom to terrorists held by terrorist groups. Nearly seven-in-ten (70%) approve of the policy, while only 25% disapprove.
Indian Americans do not have a majority religious group. Roughly half of Indian Americans (51%) identify themselves as Christian, according to a 2012 Mosalc of Falthusian Council on Foreign Relations. Among Indian Americans, the religiously unaffiliated are the highest among religious groups in the country, with roughly eight-in-ten (78%) saying they are Catholic, including 10% who are Protestant.
As has been the case over the past year, Obama’s ratings on both economic and foreign policy are negative on balance. Currently, 34% say they approve of the way Obama is handling the economy while 57% disapprove. On foreign policy, Obama garners more negative ratings than positive on the economy.
A majority of Spaniards say they trust the state and politicians, but less so than in the past. In a 2019 survey, 76% said they trust politicians and 76% agreed with the statement that most elected officials care what people like them think. This was largely unchanged from 2013, when 72% voiced confidence in the same.
Across the six EU member countries, a median of 61% have a favorable opinion of the EU, while just 21% hold an unfavorable view. In the six countries surveyed, the balance of opinion is roughly the reverse: 52% see the EU favorably, while 41% say the economy is bad. In 2013, more than six-in-ten in these six member states agreed.
By a wide margin, more women than men say they vote Democratic than Republicans. This is the case in 2012, with 66% of women ages 18- 29 voting Democratic compared with 48% of men 50 and older. In 2008, it was the case for Democrats: 57% of those 65 and older voted for Clinton and 48% voted for Obama.
Two examples illustrate this pattern. Democrats with a high degree of science knowledge are much more likely than those with low science knowledge to say the scientific method generally produces accurate conclusions (86% vs. 52%). Among Republicans, however, there are only modest differences by science knowledge on this question.
When asked about the current Congress’ productivity compared with those of previous Congresses, 38% say that this Congress has been less productive than in the past Congresses; 33% say it has been more productive.
Most people in the countries surveyed say China plays a less important role in the world today than it did 10 years ago. Still, a median of 70% across 25 countries say having China as the world’s top economic power would be better for the world. Only 19% think a more important role for China.
Trump’s confirmed judges have had more votes than those of other recent presidents at the same juncture in their presidency. The average number of confirmed judges was 22.6 votes per year for George W. Bush, who received his most recent Senate confirmation votes in January 2017. That compares with 0.5 votes for Clinton, 1.0 for George H.W. Bush and 0.0 votes for Obama.
The UN gets positive reviews in most of the countries surveyed. In fact, six-in-ten or more in each country have a favorable view of the UN.

In four of the six countries surveyed, three-quarters or more give the UN a positive rating.
The most recent religious survey by the Center for the People & the Press, conducted in 2013, found that nearly all members of the 114th Congress (96%) are Christian. In addition, roughly three-quarters of Congress (77%) are Protestant, compared with 61% among the general public. And roughly six-in-ten members (61%) are religiously unaffiliated. In our analysis, religious “nones” made up 57% of the congressional population in 2013.
More than two-thirds (64%) of the most secure Americans say race discrimination is the main reason why many people can’t get ahead these days. Among the least secure, 61% say immigrants strengthen the country because they take jobs hard work and talents.
A majority of Americans (49%) say the Bible should have at least “some” influence on U.S. laws, with 28% saying it should have “a great deal” of influence. About a quarter (23%) say it should conflict with the will of the people, which is a guideline for most Christian groups.
In the eight predominantly Muslim countries surveyed, support for the U.S. military campaign against Saddam Hussein is roughly evenly divided. 51% say the war in Iraq makes the world a safer place, while 37% say it makes the World less dangerous. On this point, majorities in France and Germany are more likely than those in Great Britain to say that the Iraq war made the world more dangerous.
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, conducted January 5-9 among 1,503 adults finds that by two-to-one (60% to 27%) Americans see China’s economic strength as a greater threat than its military strength. And as Obama goes into talks with the Chinese president, a 53% majority say it is very important for the U.S. to get tougher with China on trade and economic issues.
Education levels have increased since the 1960s. In 2016, 17.2% of immigrants ages 25 and older had a bachelor’s degree or higher, up from 12.3% in 1960. The share of immigrants with a postgraduate degree has also risen since then.

This compares with 44% who say the economy is very good. Swedes are particularly negative, with 76% saying their economy is doing poorly. Greeks are the most likely to rate their economy negatively (97%).
The Pew Hispanic survey also explored the reasons Hispanic immigrants who are legal permanent residents haven’t yet tried to become citizens. According to the survey, when asked in an open-ended question why they had not naturalized thus far, 45% identified either personal barriers (26%), such as a lack of English proficiency, or the financial cost of naturalization.
Voter turnout rates for the Silent generation have fallen sharply compared with those of older generations. In 2008, for example, 76% of Baby Boomers voted. Today, 46% of Silents say they voted. The lowest voter turnout rate for Generation X (those ages 18 and older) has fallen from 76% in 1996 to 46% in 2012.
In the 2016 election, a wide gap in presidential preferences emerged between those with and without a college degree, our post-election analysis of national exit poll data found. College graduates backed Clinton by a 9-point margin (52%-43%), while those without a high school degree backed Trump 52%-44%. This was by far the widest gap in support among college graduates and non-college graduates in exit polls dating back to 1980.
A new Pew Research Center survey of teens ages 13 to 17 in the U.S. finds that teens are more likely than their peers to say they frequently or never see other students pray before a school lunch. About four-in-ten teens (39%) say this, compared with 12% of teens overall. And while the share of teens who say this in both types of schools is similar across all public school groups, there are differences by age and religious belief.
A little over half (53%) of the 615,000 registered anti-Semitic acts in France so far this year say they were motivated by anti-Semitism, according to the Commission Nationale des Combits de d’Homme (CNCDH). The number of reported acts against people and property has more than doubled since 2011, when 59,000 were cited.
While there was less media coverage of the immigration debate last week than the previous week, the public remained intensely focused on the situation in Iraq. Roughly a quarter of the public (26%) followed news about events in Iraq very closely and 26% listed Iraq as the single news story they followed more closely than any other. By comparison, 23% say the 2008 presidential campaign was their top news story of the week.
About four-in-ten U.S. adults (42%) say it is better for a woman who wants to reach high political office to have children early, according to a separate Pew Research Center survey conducted in June and July. Just 19% say it’s better for women to not have children at all. The gender gap is much wider among Democrats (20%) than Republicans (21%).
The survey finds that roughly nine-in-ten Israeli Jews identify with a conservative ideology or stream. But the majority of Israeli Jews also say they do not identify with other political groups or movements within Judaism, including Haredi (88%), Dati (88%) and Masorti (64%).

In a 2018 Pew Research Center survey, 45% said relations between the rich and the poor had gotten better over this period, while 27% felt worse. And roughly six-in-ten (59%) said corruption, terrorism and prices of goods have gotten worse.
There also is broad public agreement that the president-elect will need to be more cautious in expressing his views once he takes office. About eight-in-ten Americans (82%) – including large majorities of Republicans and (76%) and Democrats (90%) – say that once he becomes president, Trump “will need to have a more cautious about the kinds of things he says and tweets.” Just 15% of the public says there is no need for Trump to change the types of things they say and tweet.
As previous Pew Research Center surveys have shown, partisans are divided over how much coverage of the candidates’ experience. Republicans and Republican leaners are more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to say there has been too little coverage of each candidate’s experience (44% vs. 33%). By contrast, Republicans and Democrats are more evenly divided: 49% say there is been too much coverage, while 44% say it has been the right amount.
In the new survey, McConnell and Schumer get almost no positive ratings from registered voters in the opposing party. About half of registered voters (51%) give McConnell a cold rating on the scale (0 to 100), while nearly as many (48%) give him a warm rating (23%).
In India, views of Muslims are decidedly less positive among Hindus. Just 27% of Hindus have a favorable view of Muslims, compared with 65% of Muslims. This negative sentiment is similar to the prevailing view among Hindus that is the case among Buddhists, according to the Mobile Technology & Socia survey in 11 emerging economies.

For example, in North America, where the CFL is manufactured, 84% of all residential light bulbs fell in 2015, compared with 65% in 2014. By contrast, in the West, 53% of annual light bulb sales were for adult households. (The Canadian public is split on this trend, with 43% saying they don’t know what to think about this.)
As President Obama and Democratic leaders mounted what was characterized as the final push to pass health care reform legislation last week, the public followed the health care debate more closely than any other major story (66% say they followed this story most closely). The debate also topped media coverage.
Americans in both major parties now see China much more negatively than in the recent past, but Republicans have been more likely than Democrats to express skepticism across a range of measures, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. The survey, conducted March 3 to 29, comes as Donald Trump and Joe Biden both make China a key campaign issue ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.

A decade ago, the share of U.S. women who attended religious services at least once a week dropped to 38%. Today, women are more likely than men to say they attend services weekly (38% vs. 40%). In the mid-1980s, religious attendance was much lower for men: Only 10% of men and 6% of women attended services weekly.
Bucking a long-range trend of declining viewership, the audience for local TV news grew in all three major time slots in 2013. In the late night slot (11 p.m. to 2 a.m.) newscasts, 20% of voters said they had tuned in to local news. This audience barely edged up—by.5%—in the early evening slot (5 a. m.), a newscast that had suffered the biggest decreases in recent years.
For the second week in a row, the plight of six miners trapped in Chile dominated public interest. Though coverage of the miners fell off significantly from the previous week, 21% say this was the story they followed most closely last week, while 15% say they followed news about the economy most closely.
Overall, the union share of wage and salary workers in the U.S. has declined over the past several decades, but the overall share who are represented by a union has remained steady, according to data from the BLS. The falloff in union membership was most pronounced in the early 1980s, when 25.1% of all wage and wage workers belonged to a union. In 2018, about six-in-ten (59.6%) union members, or about 20.3% of the total, were employed in unions. Back in 1983, the highest union share in the workforce was 20.1%.

There has been considerable interest in specific demographic breakdowns of the general public’s answers to science-related questions that Pew Research covered in its recent report on science knowledge and the gaps between citizens and scientists’ opinions on a range of issues. Here are additional demographic estimates based on the survey, as well as on a nationally representative sample of 2,002 U.S. adults.
Overall, the survey finds that the public likes leaders who are willing to compromise, even if unpopular, but also likes those who stick to their positions. A 67% majority also likes political leaders who will make compromises in order to get the job done, while 28% disapprove.

Roughly three-quarters of UK adults say they tend to trust television, television and the press, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March and April of this year. About four-in-ten say they think of television as the media they generally trust, which is roughly double the share that say the same about the press. Television remains the most trusted source for EU news, but that is down from 75% in 2010, when it was first measured. Similar drops in trust were seen in the press’s ratings over the same period.
We asked about the racial makeup of the generations earlier this year and found that 43% of the population is non-white, including 39% of Millennials and 21% of Gen Xers. This is a considerably higher share than for earlier generations, including Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation.
These findings come from Pew Research Center’s new survey of 1,001 U.S. Muslim adults, conducted Jan. 23 to May 2, 2017. The poll also finds that many Muslim Americans (71%) think the Republican Party is unfriendly toward Muslim Americans, and believe the party is neutral in its dealings with the group. About three-quarters (74%) of Muslim Americans say President Trump is unfriendly toward lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

Unemployment declined during George H.W. Bush’s second term in office. In the end, however, a spike in unemployment contributed to his leaving office with one of the lowest approval scores of the modern era. When Bush was inaugurated in January 2001, unemployment stood at 4.2%. The rate rose markedly following the Sept. 11 attacks, peaking at 6.3% in June 2003. Nonetheless, it remained at 5.8% at the end of his second term.

Democrats and Republicans have strikingly different views of their own party’s presidential candidates. In the most recent survey, 57% of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters say they have an excellent or good impression of the candidates running for the Democratic nomination. That is identical to the share who said this in 2007.
Another way of looking at the data is to compare the rate of annual increase on a quarterly basis, i.e. the percent growth in population from the same quarter in the previous year. Again, the first quarter of 2007 is strikingly different from the average across the eight quarters that preceded it. On average, this population grew at a rate of 1.4% a year in 2005 and 2006 On average it grew a smaller rate (4.2% a quarter in 2005 to 5.1% in 2007).

Today, roughly half of Americans (54%) name the US. as the top economy, whereas roughly one-third (32%) name China – an 18 percentage point difference.
Certain popular YouTube channels were recommended repeatedly in this analysis. This analysis illustrates how YouTube’s recommendation engine encourages users to engage with progressively more personalized content. The videos encountered in the first step of these random walks (that is, the initial starting videos chosen at random) collectively averaged between two and 10 times each month. But those videos were chosen for a random walk of at least one video, and not just one video at random. Overall, 72% of users were recommended for each of these five random walks.
Most Americans continue to say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the nation’s economy, though the percentage hearing mostly bad news has ticked up since last month.
Bias is not the only potential problem arising from survey non-coverage. Because the decline of landline coverage has not been uniform across demographic groups, some key subgroups in surveys based only on landlines may be severely underrepresented, making reliable estimates of attitudes or behaviors among those groups difficult or impossible to obtain. For example, respondents ages 8 to 24 now constitute just 7% of a typical landline sample, less than one-third of their proper proportion in the population according to the latest American Community Survey estimates (22%). The shortfall is not limited just to the very young, in part because many people maintain phone
While Hispanics and blacks are underrepresented in most STEM occupations, their presence is more pronounced among some groups of workers. Among workers in health care occupations, 73% of employed whites are in these occupations, compared with 68% of blacks. In addition, STEM workers are overrepresented in several other occupations, such as engineering, technology, engineering and math (68% each), physical science (68%) and life science (67%).

Throughout Obama’s two terms, Democrats have held a sizable lead in leaned House seats, holding at least a slight edge. Currently, 54% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they back Democratic candidates, compared with 26% of Republicans and Republican leaners (who hold a similar lead).
Looking at a comprehensive analysis of the public’s views of economic indicators, we also find that Republican and Democratic-leaning independents are most likely to cite the economy as the single most important factor they rely on most closely. The stock market is particularly important to Democrats. While regression analysis of survey data shows that Republicans are more likely than Democrats to express positive views of the economy, it is important to note that personal finances are at least as important as national security concerns.
Remarkably, 72% said most people in Hungary are actually worse off today economically than they were under communism, while only 8% thought most people are better off and 16% said things are about the same. Again, Hungary stands apart from the other post-communist societies surveyed — in no other country did so many believe that economic life is worse now than during the communist era.
But while the overall turnout rate in House and Senate elections typically lags that in midterm elections, so too has spending on congressional campaigns. In 2014, for example, the House voters cast 87 million votes, compared with just 59,000 in the Senate elections. Total votes cast in congressional elections typically rise or fall over the same period.
About four-in-ten Americans (44%) say they have heard “a lot” about negotiations between the United States and North Korea, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted earlier this year.

Pew Research Center has increased the share of U.S. adults living in households with only cellphone numbers in surveys since 2004, and will conduct more survey interviews this year than in past years. In fact, the last time we asked about this question in a Pew Research Center survey was in 2004, just over half of American adults (47%) were living on a cell phone. This is the first time that the Center has conducted more interviews on a cellphone than on landlines.
New Zealand has experienced “mostly” low levels of religion-related social hostilities in the past decade, according to the same Pew Research Center study. In fact, since we began tracking this issue in 2007, the country has consistently scored “poor” on the study’s Social Hostilities Index. Much of the hostility is directed against low-caste Dalits (people who say they are Christian, agnostic or “nothing in particular”). In addition, the number of Christians and Muslims killed in New Zealand has been significantly higher than in any other country we have surveyed.
Today, in many countries, ratings for President Trump look very similar to those for Bush at the end of his term. This pattern is especially clear in Western Europe. In France, Germany, the UK, Spain and Spain, the low levels of confidence in Trump are very like the poor ratings for Bush in 2008.
Since 1965, the number of U.S. immigrants living in this country has surpassed that of their total population, according to new Pew Research Center projections based on 2015 data.

In the Center’s study of the congressional Facebook audience, we found that congressional leaders were more likely to focus on local issues on Facebook than other members of Congress. The disparity was most pronounced in Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and congressional leaders, with about 1% of all members expressing local issue posts on Facebook.

Religion is central to the identity of European Muslims. With the exception of Muslims in Turkey, they tend to identify themselves primarily as Muslim rather than as British, Spanish, or German. In Indonesia, however, only 39% of Muslims identify primarily as Turks.
In 2011, only 11% of Mexicans said they were confident that the government was making progress in their fight against drug traffickers. Today, six-in-ten believe the government is making progress and 45% say it is losing ground. The government’s advantage in this area has been 30 percentage points since 2011.
By 55% to 35%, Hispanics say that they think being able to live and work in the United States legally without the threat of deportation is more important for unauthorized immigrants than a pathway to citizenship.

In both cases, these differences are much smaller.
The public remains divided over whether or not Israel and the Palestinian state can coexist peacefully, with 46% saying they think they can, while 44% do not.

Overall, 56% of registered voters say they have given a lot of thought to the presidential candidates, which is about the same as at this point in the 2008 and 2007 campaigns. This is slightly higher than the share of voters who say the same in both 2008 and 2008.
For the first time in more than two decades of Pew Research Center surveys, there has been a rise in blacks’ support for gun rights. In the current survey, as many Americans say it is more important for blacks to protect the rights of whites (47%) as say it matters more to Hispanics (21%).
A Pew Research Center poll after the Sandy Hook shootings found a modest uptick in the percentage of Americans saying it’s more important to control gun ownership than protect the right of Americans to own guns. But a bill that proposed tighter background checks failed in the Senate in April and by May the uptick in support for gun control fell back down. According to an analysis of state gun laws by The New York Times, more states have loosened gun restrictions than tightened them since the Connecticut school shooting.
Only 9% of Hispanic registered voters say they correctly identified the month of their state’s primary or caucus. This is especially true of Hispanic Democrats, who are more likely than other Democratic voters to identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party.

The high point for Hispanics in this period was in the early 1990s, when the recession started.
The nation’s wealth gap has widened over the past decade, with families receiving $171,000 in wealth from 2007 to 2016. In 2016, the median wealth of U.S. households was 75.7 times that of lower-income families, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Federal Reserve data. This is nearly double the wealth of families in 2007 ($66,100) and more than four times the net worth of those families in 2013 ($52,100). The wealth gap between upper-income households also increased from $44,100 in 2007 to $45,500 in 2016. However, the

Majorities in most of the 11 countries express unfavorable views of the Islamic militant group, although the exception is Pakistan, where a majority offer no opinion.
The GOP nomination contest has remained largely stable nationwide. Despite state polls that show very close races in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, Mitt Romney maintains a 20-point lead over Barack Obama among registered Republican and Republican-leaning voters nationwide (47% to 29%).

Venezuelans are increasingly confident in their president’s ability to do the right thing regarding world affairs. In a 2008 poll by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, more than three-in-four Venezuelans said they had a lot or some confidence in then-President Hugo Chávez to handle international affairs. This was not the case in 2002, when the Venezuelan public was evenly divided on this issue (42% have a lot of confidence, 47% have not much confidence).
Public opinion about government funding is more divided today than it was a few years ago. A majority of Americans (61%) continue to say that government investment is essential for scientific progress, while 34% say private funding will ensure enough progress even without government funding.

For example, the number of tweets Americans used about the events in Ferguson stood at 3.648 million, much higher than the number saying they had on Twitter after the shooting of Trayvon Martin (3.648). At the same time, Facebook and Twitter users have substantially increased their overall Twitter use of the Ferguson story.

Last June, opinions were more positive – 24% said the retail sales news was mostly good while 16% said it was mostly bad. Yet half said the job situation was mixed, virtually the same as today.
If the narrative that polls are broken is correct, one place it is likely to manifest is in trend-lines for these fundamental concepts. Specifically, two trend lines (one line for the benchmark high response rate survey and one line for for the telephone poll) which used to be similar back in the 1990s or early 2000s, for example, perhaps would have been expected to diverge by 2016, as single-digit polls are no longer capable of producing unbiased estimates. This scenario is not borne out in the data.
Overall, about three-quarters of Republicans and Republican leaners (77%) say they are optimistic about the future of their party. Democrats are about equally likely to say this (77% optimistic).

Finally, I examine the industries and occupations where unauthorized immigrants live. This testimony draws heavily from a report the Pew Research Center released last week (March 11, 2013).

Some eight-in-ten White voters (80%) report having been contacted by Trump’s campaign or other group around the month of the election, compared with about half (48%) of those 50 and older. By contrast, smaller shares of Black (70%), Hispanic (72%) and Asian voters (57%) say they had been contacted in the same way.

However, only a narrow majority (52%) says she is qualified to serve as president, while 39% say she is not qualified.
The British public has consistently had more negative views of the EU than positive views across the five EU countries Pew Research Center has surveyed in 2016.

And about six-in-ten (61%) say having a lot of information makes them feel like they have more control over things in their life.
Black Americans are underrepresented in the U.S. newsroom employment. About three-quarters (76%) of newsroom employees – those who work as reporters, editors, photographers and videographers in the newspaper, broadcasting and internet publishing industries – are non-Hispanic whites, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of 2012-2017 American Community Survey data. This is true of 64% of workers overall.

Over the past two years, the stock market (as measured by the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 index) has recovered much more strongly than housing, and it stands at its highest point in nearly two decades. The S&P 500, which was up more than 20% between January 2009 and February 2013 (the first trading day of each month), stands almost exactly where it did four years ago. (See this post for more discussion of the index, “Key facts about the index and other indicators.”)

For instance, they are more likely to believe that life in Turkey, Nigeria and the Palestinian territories is better today than it was 50 years ago. And more Nigerians than Indians share this view.
The survey finds that Mexicans’ views of the U.S. have changed dramatically over the past two years. In polling conducted in Mexico before and after the passage of the Arizona law, about six-in-ten (62%) Mexicans have a favorable view of the United States while 44% have an unfavorable view. By contrast, the balance of opinion in the rest of the country has remained roughly the same.

Europeans’ skepticism about the EU can be found in several key European countries. In several countries, traditional political parties are losing support while anti-establishment parties are gaining strength.

Mobile phone non-users tend to be more settled in their countries than people in other emerging economies. As previous Pew Research Center surveys have shown, people in emerging and developing nations are often more divided over whether they want their own device to run on a mobile device in the future. Although across the eight countries surveyed, mobile non-using people are in slight disagreement on this question. Kenyans, South Africans and Lebanese are almost evenly split on the question.
While the Boston bombings riveted most Americans, the incident appeared to confirm the public’s long-held belief that occasional terrorist acts are to be expected. Over the past decade, majorities have consistently said that “occasional acts of terrorism in the U.S. will be part of life in the future.” This sentiment has spiked to 75% in the wake of the Boston attacks from 64% a year ago and now matches the previous high of 74% in 2003.

Today, according to new Pew Research Center data not yet released in a report, 88% of French respondents say they have confidence in the U.S. president to do the right thing in world affairs. In stark contrast, just 14% had confidence in Bush during his last year in office. Across Europe, Obama has received more favorable reviews than Bush, but the gap between the two American leaders has been especially wide among Europeans. And while Obama’s ratings have slipped a bit over time in countries such as Britain, Spain and Poland, they’ve remained relatively steady in France, with roughly nine-in-

But generations cover a long period of time. Generations typically encompass a cohort of people born over a 15- to-18-year span; for example, the Baby Boom generation includes people born between 1946 and 1964. As a result, the formative political experiences of the youngest and oldest members of each generation can differ considerably, and these differences may be reflected in divergent political attitudes and partisanship within generations.

The total is up from 2014, when 3.1 million to 3.7 million unauthorized migrants lived in the region. The growth in the number of unauthorized migrants since 2014 has been driven by migration of both legal immigrants and refugees entering Europe.

When asked about the tradeoff between democracy and stability, 55% of Egyptians say that stability is more important, even if there is a risk it won’t be fully dematic. Only 38% think that a political instability provides greater stability. This is a shift from 2012, when Egyptians placed a greater priority on stability than political instability.
As Obama prepares to announce his long-awaited decision on the Iran nuclear agreement, the public’s views of the agreement have changed little in recent months.

By a wide margin, Ukrainians say the EU is having a good influence on their country. When asked to rate the EU’s influence on Ukraine, 45% of Ukrainians say it is a bad thing, while just 22% say the same about the Russian government. By contrast, majorities in both the U.S. (38%) and Russia (67%) are far more negative.
When Pew Research Center first began tracking cell phone ownership in 2002, 8% of adults in each country said they own a cell phone. The percentage of adults who own a phone has steadily increased over the last decade, from 9% in 2002 to 34% in 2013.

In contrast, the share of Hispanic eligible voters living in North Carolina (9%), Florida (8%), South Carolina (5%) and Florida (3%) increased by less than 1%.
A record 61% of U.S. children today live with two married parents, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data. This is especially true of those in their first marriage. In 1960, 46% of children lived with two divorced parents. Today, 15% of kids live with one married parent. A slightly smaller share of children live with single married parents (14%), including 5% who are single parents.
Despite the overall belief that trade is good for the economy, however, the public in TTIP nations are less convinced. A median of 50% among the five TPP nations surveyed say trade with other countries leads to job creation, while just 15% think it is more important for the U.S. to get out of the deal. The French are about as likely as the other publics surveyed to say TTIP benefits the creation of jobs.
Similarly, Americans are dissatisfied with the government’s anti-terrorism policies. Nearly six-in-ten (58%) say the government has not gone far enough in protecting the country, while 35% say it has gone too far in restricting civil liberties. In January, shortly after the failed Christmas Day attack on an airliner, 49% said the government had not gone enough in national security, while 47% said it gone too negative.
Rather than crushing them with too much information and making it hard to find useful material, most Americans say the internet and cell phones have brought benefits in learning, sharing and diversifying the flow of information into their lives. A new survey by the Pew Research Center finds that the vast majority of Americans believe their use of the web helps them learn new things, stay better informed on topics that matter to them, and increases their capacity to share ideas and creations with others.
When asked which country is the world’s leading economic power, Germans and Americans are more likely to name China. Half of Americans say China is the top economy in the world, while 32% name the U.S. Around one-in-four Germans (14%) say the same about Japan.
The share of Americans saying they do not want their own representative in Congress reelected – 38% – is at its highest point in two decades.
The share of Americans who read e-books is growing more quickly than it has been for audio books, however. Three-quarters of U.S. adults (76%) say they have read a book in print within the past year, up 17 percentage points from 74% in 2011. The growth in e-book reading has been driven entirely by the increase in the share of those who say they read printed books.
While the total number of newspaper loans approved to companies was less than $150,000, newspaper companies also experienced higher employment rates on average than those with smaller loans. The average number of PPP loans to newspaper companies was about two,325, and the typical number of papers had an average of about 40,000 jobs per loan.
One-in-seven U.S. adults (24%) say the use of anonymous sources has a great deal or some influence on whether they think news stories are being credible, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in February and March. That compares with 14% who say anonymous sources are only acceptable in certain cases and 13% who think they are used only in special cases.
To determine the size of the multiracial population, we combined two or more races to describe each of their grandparents. This process is used in a variety of ways. First, many of the responses to this question are indistinguishable from each other, and very few are from the other race. Multiracial adults are also more likely to say that at least one of their parents was not the same race as them (for example, or that their parents were not that close to them (or that their grandparents were also intermarriages), but that could not be the case. Smaller shares of the population (4.9
A second way of looking at the women’s role in Fortune 500 companies is by asking respondents which women they prefer to be their boss. In the most recent survey, 75% of women said they prefer a boss who is an 100% woman, compared with 48% of men. But aside from women”s experiences in the workforce, there has been a long-term increase in the preference for women as chief executives. In 2003, when the first women to take the reins in the U.S., three-in-four women CEOs were women. The increase has been driven by the rise of women CEOs
When it comes to how stores greet customers for Christmas, the overall share of U.S. adults who say it does not matter has fallen from 45% in 2005 to 32% today. Meanwhile, about half of Americans (52%) say they would prefer stores or businesses to greet customers one way or another, up from 12% in 2013.
Majorities in most of the 33 non-European countries surveyed disapprove of the U.S. increasing tariffs on imported goods from other countries (median 68% disapproval), its withdrawal from international climate change agreements (66%), and its construction of a wall on the border between the United States and Mexico (60%). Trump’s positions on these issues are met with negativity: Across all countries surveyed, medians of 55% and 52%, respectively, disapprove of these steps.
The public continues to express little confidence in the federal government’s ability to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. About four-in-ten (43%) say they are very confident that federal authorities are doing a very good job responding to the outbreak, while just 12% say they aren’t doing too good. A similar share (49%) says they are at least somewhat confident in state and local officials to do a good job.
Americans’ and Mexicans’ views of one another have become less harsh since turning intensely negative in the wake of one of the world’s most powerful countries, the United States.
Roughly seven-in-ten Democratic and Democratic registered voters (72%) say they have given a lot of thought to this election, compared with 71% of Republicans. The partisan gap is much narrower than at comparable points in the past two elections.
Democrats continue to be more likely than Republicans to say news stories are often inaccurate – a gap that has grown wider over the past 15 years.
On the other hand, Democrats and independents who lean toward the parties are more likely to say they favor expanding production from fossil fuel energy sources. For example, more than eight-in-ten Democrats (84%) favor expanding offshore oil and gas drilling, compared with just half of Republicans (50%).
How Overtime-related job losses have affected the American workforce? Our analysis of the 2014 employment data finds that nearly half (49%) of the nearly 2.9 million people who were employed in the past year in five types of occupations – accounting for 49% of the total – were in the retail sector, while about a quarter (24%) of those in the office and financial sector.
The overall U.S. per capita trade advantage with Germany has more than doubled since 2009, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. Over the same period, the bilateral trade deficit with Germany fell by more than half, to $250 per capita compared with $266 per capita with China. This is largely unchanged from a year ago.
The United States is home to more college-educated immigrants than any other country. As of 2015, there were 14.7 million immigrants ages 25 and older with a postsecondary diploma or college degree living in the U.S. – more than triple the number in Canada (3.4 million) and more than four times as many as in the United Kingdom (3 million), according to a recent Pew Research Center report.

Our most recent survey on the issue, conducted July 26-29, 2012, shortly after a gunman killed 12 people at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, found a 46% majority saying it was more important to control gun ownership, while 46% said it was More important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns. Opinions were largely unchanged from April 2012, when 45% prioritized gun control and 49% gun rights.
The online political campaign is growing more common since 2008, as more than half of online political donations (69%) went online. But most campaign donors today make only online contributions, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of adults conducted Aug. 16-August 7. Political donations are increasingly common among online donors: six in ten online political donors in 2012 said they made their political donations only online, up from 15% in 2008.
The public’s perceptions of economic news remain mixed, but are far less positive than they were in early 2009.

Last month, 38% said the news was mostly bad.
The June survey also shows the public is unlikely to be satisfied with the Supreme Court’s ruling – no matter what the court decides. Whether the Court decides to uphold the entire law, reject the “individual mandate” while allowing the rest of the law to remain in place, fewer than half of Americans say they would be happy with the decision.
Before the COVID-19 outbreak, similar shares of white Democrats and Democratic leaners had expressed at least a fair amount of confidence in police officers to act in the best interests of the public. Among Democrats, however, white Democrats were much more likely than white Republicans to say they had a great deal of confidence (72% vs. 53%).
When asked about the world’s leading military power, Russians overwhelmingly think the U.S. is the dominant military power. More than eight-in-ten say China is the top military power (83%), compared with just 6% who say the same about the US. Overall, three-quarters of Russians (91%) agree that America is the strongest military leader, compared with only 4% who name China.
In general, people have expressed more interest in news about the terrorist attacks in London than they did about the car bombing in Tehran.

Of these, consumer attitudes and awareness of VolP are more broadly positive than they have been since the mid-1990s. For instance, among people who have considered becoming a home phone owner, 34% have considered it a “major problem” that they might not want to own, and 25% have even considered a potential problem. In other words, those who say they have considered a VolP but haven’t personally experienced it are considerably more likely to be aware of it than those who have not heard of it.
A slightly smaller share (27%) of college graduates are producing content for mobile devices. Of those in the general public who have completed at least a bachelor’s degree, 28% are producing mobile content and 27% are writing and Editing. About one-in-five (22%) are online gaming. These figures are well below the percentages that graduated from college.
The Republican Party also draws less support than the Tea Party. About three-quarters (76%) of Republicans say that immigrants now living in the U.S. illegally should be able to gain citizenship if they meet certain requirements, while 25% say they should not be eligible for citizenship. Among the largest group of Republicans, 59% say immigrants should be allowed to apply for citizenship, but just 25% of Republicans agree.
The public’s views about gun control have changed little in recent years. Currently, 47% say it is more important to control gun ownership than protect the right of Americans to own guns, while 49% say gun rights are more important. In the past, there has been a wide and consistent gap on the issue.
The war in Iraq continued to attract broad public attention, despite drawing far less news coverage than the Imus flap. Overall, 26% of Americans say they followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely, and 31% cited the war as the story they followed most closely from October through November.
The rapid growth of the U.S. Hispanic population has been helped by two main groups: Asians and Hispanics. The two groups accounted for 61% of the overall population growth during the 2012-2013 period, most of which was driven by immigration, according to new Census Bureau data.
Overall, 68% of the public has a favorable opinion of NASA, with 17% viewing it unfavorably. But among those who have completed college, the gap is much narrower: 78% view NASA favorably, while just 13% have an unfavorable opinion.
The partisan gap over marijuana legalization has widened in recent years. In the new survey, 201% of Democrats say they favor legalizing the use of marijuana, compared with just 25% of independents. That is virtually unchanged from 2000. As recently as 2006, more Democrats (52%) than Republicans (35%) supported marijuana legalization.
The survey finds that most Americans support allowing transgender people to use restrooms that correspond to their current gender identity. In a 2016 Pew Research Center survey, 51% said transgender people should be able to use the restroom that matches the gender with which they currently identify, while 46% said they should be required to. transgender people were considerably more likely than men (55% vs. 52%) to support this.
Since 2011, the share of the public saying there are “very strong” or “strong” conflicts between blacks and whites has increased from 39% to 62%.
The Palestinian Authority’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, gets low ratings for his handling of the Gaza Strip: Just 2% have a favorable opinion of Hamas, while 75% have an unfavorable opinion. This opinion has fluctuated in recent years, with the current poll showing a positive direction for the organization. In 2011, a majority (56%) of Palestinians had a favorable view of the Hamas.
Major economic news also drew heavy coverage and widespread interest last week. In all, the stimulus package was by far the public’s most closely followed news story. About three-in-ten (31%) say they followed news about the economy very closely and 10% cited the economy as their top story of the week.
These so-called “opt-out moms” (roughly seven-in-ten mothers who live with their children younger than 18 at home) make up a very small share of the nation’s 35 million mothers who are stay-at-home moms. But our analysis also finds that highly educated moms are less likely than their highly educated counterparts to work outside the home.
The generation of Central and Eastern Europeans who came of age after the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the Soviet Union differs little in its political outlook from earlier generations weaned on communist ideology and anti-Western propaganda. Today, support for gay marriage is relatively tepid among both age groups. Majorities in most countries across the region are opposed to same-sex marriage.
Suspected bots also accounted for 66% of tweeted links to popular news and current events websites. That’s a lower share than for sites that were “born on the web”, but higher than for those who were born on the internet. Democratic and Republican-leaning websites, those with more than 1 million followers, and those with less than a home page were more likely to be linked to sites on the site.
As the Senate works toward a compromise on immigration reform, the public broadly supports two measures that would likely result in tighter border security. Large majorities of U.S. adults (71%) say that unauthorized immigrants living in the country illegally should be allowed to stay and that it is necessary to apply for legal status. This legislation does not meet the public’s expectations.
Guatemalan immigrants have been the most likely to be apprehended in the U.S. since at least 2006. In 2012, for example, 50.4 Guatemalan immigrants were apprehended compared with 50.9 for Salvadorans and 21.5 for Mexicans. By comparison, El Salvador had the second-highest number of apprehended Honduran immigrants in 2012, at 25.9 per 100,000 people.
Socioeconomic status also affects the congregational characteristics that congregational shoppers value most. Location-based congregations are more likely to say they have talked to friends and colleagues about information online (77% of congregations between $30,000 and $75,000) than say they has attended services at a new congregation (44%). And about two-thirds of congregational members either paid close attention to or heard from their congregation’s members (65%), but not at all about the frequency of these outreach.
Younger Americans are much more skeptical that U.S. involvement in world affairs than their older counterparts. Roughly two-thirds of Americans ages 18 to 29 (64%) say that nation’s efforts in world problems don’t make much of a difference without its involvement, compared with a smaller share (23%) of those 65 and older.
A majority of Americans (55%) say they have decided not to use products or services because they were worried about how much personal information would be collected about them. But this varies by product or service usage. Some 64% of Americans say they’ve decided NOT to use a product or services in the past 12 months.
At the same time, there has been a sharp rise in domestic spending on R&D, even as the U.S. and China have remained relatively steady at their own economies. In 2018, China spent an estimated $600,000 per year on research and development, compared with $400,000 in the EU-28,000 annual spend managed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Roughly seven-in-ten in Japan (71%) and South Korea (68%) said they spent more than $100,000.
Overall, a survey finds that partisans are more likely than partisans to express confidence in six different activities during the coronavirus outbreak. But there is a biggest partisan gap in comfort with activities.
Looking at Google’s Trends data for the specific weeks of Thanksgiving and Christmas, we found that Google search interest in the search term “buy gun” is higher during the holiday season than it was in the previous year. This is especially true during November, when roughly 81% of Google searches were conducted between November 2012 and December 2017. For other weeks of Christmas, roughly half of Google search activity was conducted on each day.
As the first debate of the 2012 presidential campaign winds down, more voters are expecting the debate to shift focus toward the debate. Currently, 37% of registered voters think Obama’s first debate will be better than that of Mitt Romney, while 29% expect him to be slightly better. This is slightly higher than the shares expecting Romney to win the debate in the first (29%) or second debate (29%).
In a separate Pew Research Center survey conducted in February, Democrats and Republicans were deeply divided over the recent news for Trump.

Overall, Hispanics made up 23% of inmates in 2017, compared with 27% of whites and 30% of Hispanic inmates.
Against this backdrop, Islamic extremist groups continue to pose the biggest threats to Italian society. More than three-quarters in Italy (74%) say they are a “major threat” to their country, as do roughly seven-in-ten in France (71%), Lebanon (67%) and India (64%).
The most recent OMB report — Budget of the U.S. Government: Fiscal Year 2011 (PDF). You can find the chart in the section titled “Summary Tables,” and a host of other information about government spending in the full report. While this chart, unfortunately, does not contain the percentages of government spending by category, you can clearly see that the outlays for national defense (labeled “security discretionary”) are again clearly larger than those for the other three programs you can choose from on the chart.
In addition, Washington Catholics are better known in New York than in New Jersey, which is part of the nation’s Catholic population. Just 17% of D.C.-area Catholic adults have a high school degree or less, compared with 26% of U.S. Catholics overall who have not completed college. At the same time, just 11% of Catholic Americans have a college degree or higher (and 19% have some college experience).
Women were more likely than men to frequently discuss sexual misconduct in their Facebook posts. Among women in Congress, 61% of those with a Facebook page called themselves sexual harassment or had been in the past, compared with 31% of men. But among both genders, there were differences by gender and age.
The public followed the economic stimulus package more closely than any other story last week by a wide margin amid continuing news of major job losses and stern warnings from Obama about the severity of the crisis. Some 35% say the stimulus package was the story they followed most closely, while 11% say they followed reports about the condition of the U.S. economy most closely.
Shifting attitudes toward China are colored, in part, by the context of the continued trade frictions and tariffs between the United States and China. Today, just over two-thirds of people in the U.S. say economic ties with China are good. A median of 66% see their country’s economic conditions as positive. But large majorities in most countries – as well as in much of China – say the same.
Overall, 55% of registered voters say the Democratic Party will do better than in recent elections — roughly double the share who said this in June 2010 (43%). Democratic and Republican-leaning voters are almost equally skeptical about their party’s chances in the 2014 midterm elections.
Fewer people in the countries surveyed believe that the world is a safer place without Saddam Hussein than say the same about the U.S. About half in Pakistan (53%), the Palestinian territories (38%) and China (37%) say that the World is no more safe. But in several countries, the view that Saddam Hussein’s power makes the world more dangerous is shared by people in other countries as well. Indians are more divided on this question, as are Germans and Poles.
Among whites, there is a wide range of opinion on whether the government can prevent offensive statements that are offensive to minorities. About six-in-ten white non-Hispanic whites (58%) favor this idea, compared with 38% of black non-white adults and only about a quarter of Hispanic Millennials (27%).
Among the eight international threats tested, the topmost on the minds of Americans is the threat of the Islamic militant group known as ISIS, whose affiliates operate in Iraq and Syria. About six-in-ten Americans (62%) say ISIS poses a major threat to their country.

A new Pew Research Center analysis examines long-term trends in women’s fertility, gender equality and mothers’ fate. The report finds that almost eight-in-ten women ages 40 to 44 (83%) had given birth to a child by their mid 30s, while just 14% of women in their 30s had done so. The researchers also found that the risk of delaying motherhood through their 20s is about the same as it was in 1994.
In its early surveys about technology use in 2000, when about half of American adults used the internet, the Pew Research Center’s Internet Project found about a tenth of those internet users placed phone calls using the internet. In its last reading in late 2012, when over 80% of Americans were internet users, the Project found that 30% of them had placed online phone calls.
The 2008 presidential campaign dominated the national news last week, driven in large part by the lively Democratic debate in Philadelphia.

Roughly half of Democrats (47%) and Republicans say the same about Democrats. Among Republicans, more Democrats say Republicans probably share their own values than say Democrats do not (47% vs. 38%).
Nearly two-thirds (64%) of unauthorized immigrants who are eligible to receive relief from deportation say they would be eligible in the future (amounting to about 700,000 people in the U.S. who were eligible to deportation in 2010). This means that about one-third of the 1.7 million unauthorized immigrants eligible to eligible have relief in the current situation.
There are also wide partisan differences on this question. For example, 71% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say that businesses that provide wedding services to same-sex couples should be able to refuse to use the restroom of the gender with their objections to homosexuality. A smaller majority of Republicans and Republican leaners (67%) say this.
The American public also expresses a more hopeful view about Cuba’s future. Across the six countries surveyed, a median of 49% say they think Cuba will become more democratic in the next few years, while 43% say Cuba will remain about as democratic as it is now. This sentiment is shared across six Latin American nations surveyed.
Western Europeans have a strong reputation for trust in the news media, parliament and banks, and most people express confidence in their military to do the right thing in world affairs. But Western Europeans also differ from Americans in many other respects, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in October and December.
As in the past, most Americans say the U.S. is one of the greatest countries in the world. The public’s views have become more divided over this issue, however.

The digital advertising market continues to grow, growing rapidly. According to eMarketer, digital advertising reached $32.8 billion in 2013, up from $30.5 in 2011. This is nearly a tripling of the revenue from mobile advertising, which reached $9.6 billion in 2012.Mobile advertising revenue comprised almost two-thirds (65%) of digital advertising revenue.
Mobile phones have had a bad influence on children in their country. A median of 79% of adults say people should be very concerned about children being exposed to harmful or immoral content when using their mobile phones. Mobile phones have the same effect on children as do mobile phones (63% very concerned). Parents whose children have a mobile phone are also more likely than those who have not to say they have a phone (50% vs. 50%). And while a median of 50% of parents say they are at least somewhat concerned about the impact of mobile phones on children, more than half (50%) say this should be the case

In the U.S., 65% of Americans expect that robots and computers will definitely or probably do much of the work currently done by humans, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in June and July 2015. A similar share (32%) of workers expect that these technologies will probably or definitely exist.
India’s religious minorities have been declining ever since the late 1970s, when Christians and Muslims accounted for a much smaller share of the overall population.

But the difference, while statistically significant, was small in absolute terms – smaller than the margin of sampling error in most polls. Obama’s average lead across the six surveys was 9.9 points among registered voters when cell phone and landline interviews were combined and weighted. If estimates had been based only on the weighted landline samples, Obama would have an average lead of 7.6 points, an average bias of 2.3 percentage points on the margin, or about 1.2 points expressed as candidate error. Limiting the analysis to likely voters rather than all voters produced similar results. Obama ran an average of 5

The only event with that kind of recall was President Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 (95%). Other notable events, from the 1969 moon landing to Osama bin Laden’nearing the top, ranked well behind. In a December 2009 poll, 53% of American adults picked the 9/

Similarly, conservative and moderate voters were slightly less likely than partisans to say they used to be Republicans (29% vs. 29%).
Recent events in Ukraine, including the capture of the pro-Russian President Viktor F.

But only 38% think cellphone use is generally OK at restaurants, and very few say it is Generally OK at a family dinner (12%), during a meeting (5%), or at church (4%).
Conservatives gravitate toward Fox News. A separate Pew Research Center survey of Republicans and Republican leaners found that 47% of consistent conservatives cited Fox News as their main source for news about government and politics; just 15% cited local TV.

In the Pew Research survey, 84% of Republicans describe themselves as “ Alternative Republicans” compared with 77% of Democrats and 86% of independents. Alternative Republicans are also much more likely to say they believe alternative energy research is better for the country than to say the same about Vehicle Fuel Standards (75% vs. 86%).
Americans’ confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping has continued to decline over the past year. Overall, around seven-in-ten U.S. adults (71%) say they do not have confidence in Xi to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs, including 58% who say they have no confidence at all in the Chinese leader. In 2018, when the Center first asked about China’s role in the COVID-19 outbreak, just 50% said they had faith in Xi.

At the same time, personal financial assessments of the less well-educated Americans have become much more negative over the past year.
When asked specifically about men and women’s jobs, somewhat fewer than half of women (46%) say men mostly prefer women as co-workers; another 25% say it does not matter. This question asks respondents whether they mostly prefer men over women as workers or not. In general, various questions related to gender, income and experience are slightly different.
Suspected bot accounts are more likely to link to popular political sites with an ideologically centrist or mixed audience than to sites with more ideologically polarized views. That is especially true of sites that have more ideological focus. Among those with a more ideological profile, 50% of links to sites associated with the Center’s political ideology were to sites such as Twitter.com (21%), Smithsonian magazine (15%), the Fox News Channel (13%) or national Review (9%). Those with a smaller audience typically do not access these sites on Twitter.
The Hispanic population reached a record 167.2 million in 1966, according to the Pew Hispanic Center’s estimates. This is nearly double the number of Hispanic immigrants living in the U.S. In 1966, for example, there were 22.3 million black immigrants and 22.5 million Hispanic immigrants in the total. Immigration from Latin America and relatively high fertility rates among Latinos were major factors in this increase. The white population grew to 167. 2 million in 1965, but it declined markedly to 201.0 million in 1968.
Only about half of the violent crimes and a third of the property crimes that occur in the United States each year are reported to police. And most of the crimes that are reported don’t result in the arrest, charging and prosecution of a suspect, according to government statistics.
A median of 65% across the member countries agree that there are parts of neighboring countries that really belong to them, while a median of just 25% disagree. In Ukraine, however, only around two-in-ten agree.

The partisan divide over dealing with global warming is especially striking. A January survey found 54% of Democrats view this as a top priority for the president and Congress compared with just 15% of Republicans. Democrats also are 31 points more likely than Republicans to prioritize protecting the environment (66% of Democrat, 35% of Republican).
People are generally pessimistic about the future of their economy. Across the 14 countries polled, a median of 46% say their country’s economic situation will be worse over the next year, while a similar share (median of 35%) say it will remain the same. The shares who believe the economy will improve are most common in Canada (48%) and the U.S. (34%). In each of these countries, more people expect the economy to worsen than improve.
Facebook remains by far the most popular social media site among American teens ages 13 to 17. 71% of all teens use Facebook, including 71% who use the site. But among teens ages 17 to 17, Instagram ranks as the second most popular site among 13- to 17-year-olds (71% use it).

At the same time, the public has become more focused on issues such as immigration (54% very important), trade policy (40%) and abortion (28%).
In addition to teasing out these differences between Twitter users and the population as a whole, this analysis also highlights the sizable diversity among Twitter users themselves. The median user tweets just twice each month, but a small cohort of extremely active Twitter users posts with much greater regularity. As a result, much of the content posted by Americans on Twitter reflects a small number of authors. The 10% of users who are most active in terms of tweeting are responsible for 80% of all tweets created by U.S. users.
On the international stage, the public does not think about the seriousness of international issues. A majority of Americans (78%) disagree with the statement “We should go our own way in international matters, not worrying too much about whether other countries agree with us or not.” This is the highest percentage agreeing since the question was first asked in 1987.
Roughly three-quarters of U.S. adults (78%) say race or ethnicity should not be a major factor in college admissions decisions, including 78% who say it should be a minor factor, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.

Meanwhile, 58% of Indians say that no matter who wins an election, change things do not very much. This again includes a majority of both BJP and Congress supporters.
The gap between the two is as large as it has been in Pew Research Center surveys dating back to 1992. In the current study, the gap is 43 points in the direction of the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning (CDWR), and it is 42 points since 1992. The last time the Center asked about it in September 2002, the previous year for which the data is available.
Americans think the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change. Some 65% of U.S. adults say climate change is affecting their local community a great deal or some. More than eight-in-ten (83%) say the government has made the right decision in addressing climate change, including 79% who favor banning carbon emission limits for cars and trucks.
Younger officers are more likely than their older counterparts to say the media treat police unfairly. In a Pew Research Center survey of 7,917 officers conducted May 19-Aug. 14, 2016, 65% of young officers said the media often or sometimes mai kiee them personally, compared with just 15% of those ages 18 to 29.

Roughly one-in-seven primary and secondary students in Europe (15%) learn English in school, according to data from the American Council for International Education. This share is similar to the share of students in the U.S. who study Spanish at some point in their education. In 2017, 91% of foreign students studied English, a share that has remained fairly stable since 2015.
As growth of this group has stalled, there has been a recent sharp rise in the median length of time that unauthorized immigrants have lived in the U.S. In 2013, according to a preliminary estimate, unauthorized immigrant adults had a median time of nearly 13 years—meaning that half had been in the country at least that long. A decade earlier, in 2003, the median for adults was less than eight years.
Millennials remain the most Democratic age cohort: 51% of Millennials identify as Democrats or lean Democratic, compared with 35% who identify as Republican or lean Republican.

Americans’ and Germans’ views of which country is the world’s leading economic power have fluctuated in recent years. Today, 49% of Americans name the U.S., while 33% name China. In 2012, only 19% said this.
Americans continued to closely track reports about the condition of the U.S. economy last week, though many also closely followed the dramatic rescue of a cargo ship captain held by Somali pirates off the coast of Africa. Close to half (52%) say they followed economic reports very closely, the same share as the previous week. For about three-in-ten (31%), this was the most closely followed story of the week. Economic stories took up about 17% of the newshole, separating out stories on state and local budget problems.

Hispanics are the nation’s youngest major racial or ethnic group. The median age of 18 for Hispanics is 28, compared with 28 for blacks and 28 for Asians. For Asians, it is 35.
Hawaii has experienced a rising share of racial and ethnic diversity in recent years, due in large part to the increasing number of U.S. immigrants and their descendants. In 2013, 62% ofHawaii’s population were white, while only 10% were black, 4% Hispanic and 3% Asian.
Another high-profile aspect of America’s recent national security strategy is also widely unpopular: drones. In nine of 11 countries surveyed, majorities or pluralities oppose U.S. drone strikes targeting extremists in countries such as Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. Moreover, opposition to drone attacks has increased in many nations since last year. Israel is the only country surveyed where at least half of the public supports drone strikes.
Opinion about expanding the use of nuclear power has fluctuated in recent years. However, the current measure matches a previous low in support for increased nuclear power recorded in September 2005 (39% favor, 53% oppose).
Hispanics are also more likely than whites to say they have been discriminated against because of their race or ethnicity. About six-in-ten (62%) of immigrants ages 18 to 29 say this, compared with 41% of the U.S. born. In addition, those ages 50 and older are more likely to say discrimination is a problem of race and ethnicity.

In the most recent survey, on the topic of gun policy, the public has divided: 50% say it is more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns, while 48% say gun control. Opinion has been divided since 1993, when the question was first asked.
Despite the overall interest and value of STEM degrees, many Americans say more people don’t pursue the degree because of the difficulty of the subjects. About half of U.S. adults (52%) say the main reason many young people lack to pursue STEM degrees is that they think these subjects are too hard. About three-in-ten say the same about their other occupations or professions.
However, Obama fares much better in the region than McCain, in many other nations. For instance, 60% of the French have confidence in Obama to do the right thing in world affairs; only 22% have such faith in McCain. This is largely unchanged from the 42% confidence in McCain in the 2008 election.
Population 2050: The share of Americans ages 15 and 65 and older who are younger than 15 is expected to rise, to 39% in 2050, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.

As the U.S. and its allies prepare to meet in the Middle East this week, a new Pew Global Attitudes survey finds that positive views of the American people are approaching their lowest point in nearly a decade. Majorities or pluralities in 26 of the 40 countries surveyed hold an unfavorable opinion of their largest American ally, falling out of favor with the most powerful nation in the region. At the same time, the percentage of people who see the American more favorably than the other major powers has risen in most of the other world regions, including Jordan (80%), Lebanon (82%) and Turkey (80%).

The 2010s will likely be the first decade in at least 160 years to see an increase in the average number of people living in U.S. households. This is in part because of the rising number of Americans living in multigenerational households. In 2016, a record 64 million people, or 20% of the U.N. population, lived with multiple generations under one roof, even with improvements in the US. economy since the Great Recession. Another factor behind the increase in household size: More Americans are “doubled up” in shared living quarters.
