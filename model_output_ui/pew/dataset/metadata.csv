no_data-10009,FIGURE1 Immigrant Share Falls Among Largest Hispanic Origin Groups since 2000 % of each group born outside of the U.S. 64%,multiColumn/imgs/4311.png,"The nation’s Hispanic population has long been characterized by its immigrant roots. But as immigration from Latin America slows, the immigrant share among each of the nation’s Hispanic origin groups is in decline, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. This report explores data of the 14 largest Hispanic origin groups, unless otherwise noted.
The foreign-born share of Salvadorans, for example, fell from 76% in 2000 to 59% in 2013—the largest percentage point decline of any of the six largest Hispanic origin groups. Similarly, Dominicans, Guatemalans, and Colombians all had decreases of over 13 percentage points in their foreign-born shares over the same period. Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, also saw a decline, though it was only 8 percentage points since 2000. A decline is underway among smaller Hispanic origin groups, too (see Appendix Table A1). Overall, the share of the Hispanic population that is foreign born has decreased from 40% in 2000 to 35% in 2013.
Despite falling immigrant shares across all Latino origin groups, fast Latino population growth has led to continued growth in the number of Latino immigrants (though growth has slowed in recent years). Among all Latinos, there were 14.1 million immigrants in 2000.

Roughly one-in-five politically engaged users (19%) indicate that they often comment, discuss or post about political issues with others on social media (just 6% of less politically engaged users post with this level of frequency). And nearly one-third of these politically engaged users feel that social media sites do “very well” at bringing new voices into the political discussion (31%) or helping people get involved with issues that matter to them (30%).
The concerns and frustrations outlined above are occurring in a broader context: namely, one in which political discussions are encroaching into a range of different social spaces. Two of the more common social media platforms – Facebook and Twitter – are illustrative in this regard.

Women still lag when it comes to holding top managerial positions. And among those with a preference, both men and women say they prefer male bosses and co-workers.
Only 24 women (about 5%) currently are CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, according to an analysis by Catalyst, a nonprofit seeking to expand opportunities for women. Yet this is up from 20 female CEOs in 2013, and only one in 1998. Less than 9% of top management positions are filled by women, and the rates have declined in some key sectors in recent years. A similar analysis by Catalyst last year — this one looking at Fortune 1000 companies — found 45 women CEOs, up from 16 a decade prior, but still less than 5% of all top jobs.
Gallup has been tracking gender preferences in the workplace since 1953, when fully two-thirds of American adults (66%) said they would prefer a male boss if they had a choice in a new job. Another 25% volunteered that it made no difference, and only 5% said they would prefer a female boss. As of November 2013, the gap has narrowed but remains.

By nearly as wide a margin, Democrats and Democratic leaners say the opposite: 60% say a person is rich because they had more advantages than others, while just 29% say it is because they have worked harder.
As with many other issues, partisan differences in views of why people are rich and poor have increased in recent years. Since 2014, the share of Republicans who say a person is rich more because they have worked harder than others has risen 12 percentage points, from 54% to 66%.

no_data-22073,News Interest vs News Coverage Iraq Interest: percent who followed this story most closely Coverage: percent of news coverage devoted to story,multiColumn/imgs/7442.png,"Most Americans feel the press has gone overboard in covering the death of Anna Nicole Smith. Fully 61% believe the Smith story has been overcovered, far more than the number saying that about any other recent story. Even so, a sizable minority (11%) followed Smith’s death more closely than any of last week’s other top stories. This is on par with the number who cited news about the 2008 presidential candidates (13%) or the Super Bowl (11%) as the stories they followed most closely. The war in Iraq was the top story for the week of Feb. 5, with 30% following it most closely.
Data collected since the start of the year suggest that the public and the press are often in agreement about the most important news stories of the day. The Iraq war has consistently been the top-ranked news story both in terms of public interest and press coverage. In the News Interest Index survey for the week of Feb. 5 (conducted Feb. 9-12), 30% of Americans said the situation in Iraq was the story they followed most closely, nearly double the next highest story – winter weather. During that same week, 22% of the news reported across a broad spectrum of media outlets was devoted to the Iraq war (12% to the policy debate and 10% to events on the ground), according to PEJ.
The death of Anna Nicole Smith, which set off a classic media feeding frenzy, may be an instance where press coverage exceeded public demand. Eleven percent of the public said Smith’s death was the news story they followed most closely last week; 9% of the week’s news coverage was devoted to this topic. But because the death occurred mid-week, the full extent of news coverage is not accurately captured by that 9% figure. In the two days immediately following Smith’s death (Feb. 8-9), nearly a quarter of the news from all sectors (24%) was devoted to this story, and fully half of cable news was focused on Smith. The public reacted negatively to the abundance of coverage – 61% feel that the Smith story received too much coverage, compared with just 8% who think it should have received more.
It seems that news coverage of the weather did not match the public’s fascination with it. Record cold temperatures and dramatic snowstorms captured the interest of many Americans this past week – 17% said the weather was their top story, while only 3% of the news coverage was devoted to this topic.",https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2007/02/16/too-much-anna-nicole-but-the-saga-attracts-an-audience/,multiColumn/data/7442.txt,bar,complex,U.S. Politics & Policy,multiColumn/bboxes/7442.json,multi_col-7442.txt,News Interest vs News Coverage  | Week of Februarys  | Iraq  | 22  | 30  | Winter weather  | 3  | 17  | 8  | 2008 Campaign 13  | Anna Nicole Smith  | 11  | Super Bowl  | Astronaut  | Interest: percent who followed this story most closely  | Coverage: percent of news coverage devoted to story

But the lead up to the invasion of Iraq produced a typical rally around the president in times of foreign crisis that kept Bush’s approval ratings quite healthy. America’s quick and relatively painless Gulf War victory sent his approval scores to record highs in the first quarter of 1991 obviating the political impact of a steady rise in unemployment … but not for long. Over the course of the remainder of the year, Bush’s approval rating tumbled, falling from a high of 86% in March to 50% in December. Over that period, the unemployment rate rose from 6.4% to 7.3%.
For much of Clinton’s first term, unemployment rates and public judgments of the president were not in close correspondence. Unemployment declined from above 7% at the time he took office to 5.5% by the end of 1994. However, Clinton’s ratings were quite mixed for much of this time reflecting political difficulties (the collapse of health care reform, and bitter fights over his crime bill and economic packages), as well as controversies over his past personal and financial involvements.

In its annual survey, BJS asks crime victims whether they reported their crime to police or not.

BJS notes that there are a variety of reasons why crime might not be reported, including fear of reprisal or “getting the offender in trouble,” a feeling that police “would not or could not do anything to help,” or a belief that the crime is “a personal issue or too trivial to report.”
Most of the crimes that are reported to police, meanwhile, are not solved, at least based on an FBI measure known as the clearance rate. That’s the share of cases each year that are closed, or “cleared,” through the arrest, charging and referral of a suspect for prosecution, or due to “exceptional” circumstances such as the death of a suspect or a victim’s refusal to cooperate with a prosecution.

For our analysis, we used the IPUMS-CPS dataset, drawn from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, a supplemental portion of which asks people about their incomes as well as their occupations, making estimation possible. (We didn’t attempt to model how employers might respond to the new rules.)
By our estimates, last year just under 4.9 million workers would have become newly eligible for overtime pay had the rule been in place. That’s somewhat more than the Labor Department’s estimate of 4.65 million, though they used pooled 2011-13 data and a more detailed methodology. (Other estimates of the number of affected workers range from 3 million, by the American Action Forum, to 5.9 million, by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research.)
Although the 4.9 million employees in our estimate worked in more than 150 separately defined occupations, just 14 occupations accounted for more than half the estimated impact.

By 2055, the U.S. will not have a single racial or ethnic majority. Much of this change has been (and will be) driven by immigration. Nearly 59 million immigrants have arrived in the U.S. in the past 50 years, mostly from Latin America and Asia. Today, a near-record 14% of the country’s population is foreign born compared with just 5% in 1965. Over the next five decades, the majority of U.S. population growth is projected to be linked to new Asian and Hispanic immigration. American attitudes about immigration and diversity are supportive of these changes for the most part. More Americans say immigrants strengthen the country than say they burden it, and most say the U.S.’s increasing ethnic diversity makes it a better place to live.
Asia has replaced Latin America (including Mexico) as the biggest source of new immigrants to the U.S. In a reversal of one of the largest mass migrations in modern history, net migration flows from Mexico to the U.S. turned negative between 2009 and 2014, as more Mexicans went home than arrived in the U.S. And after rising steadily since 1990, the unauthorized immigrant population has leveled off in recent years, falling to 11.3 million in 2014 from a high of 12.2 million in 2007. Meanwhile, Asians are now the only major racial or ethnic group whose numbers are rising mainly because of immigration.

Still, while New Zealand’s GRI score has been low since we first began measuring it in 2007, it did tick upwards slightly in 2016. This recent increase is due in part to derogatory statements made by Winston Peters, leader of the New Zealand First Party, when he said in June 2016 that certain countries “treat their women like cattle,” and suggested that all immigrants should be screened for unacceptable attitudes before being permitted to enter the country. Some media reports said he specifically referred to Muslim immigrants, which he denied.

no_data-78,"In some African countries, sizable minorities of people live in polygamous households % of individuals in polygamous households. by religion Christian Muslim Unaffiliated Folk",multiColumn/imgs/134.png,"Polygamy is most often found in sub-Saharan Africa, where 11% of the population lives in arrangements that include more than one spouse. Polygamy is widespread in a cluster of countries in West and Central Africa, including Burkina Faso, (36%), Mali (34%) and Nigeria (28%). In these countries, polygamy is legal, at least to some extent. Muslims in Africa are more likely than Christians to live in this type of arrangement (25% vs. 3%), but in some countries, the practice also is widespread among adherents of folk religions and people who do not identify with a religion. For example, in Burkina Faso, 45% of people who practice folk religions, 40% of Muslims and 24% of Christians live in polygamous households. Chad is the only country in this analysis where Christians (21%) are more likely than Muslims (10%) to live in this type of arrangement.
Religion often plays a role in how polygamy is governed and practiced within a single country. In Nigeria, for example, polygamous marriage is not allowed at the federal level, but the prohibition only applies to civil marriages. Twelve northern, Muslim-majority states do recognize these unions as Islamic or customary marriages. In India, Muslim men are allowed to marry multiple women, while men of other groups are not. However, in countries where polygamy is common, it often is practiced by people of all faiths.

no_data-9635,"Vote totals may rise or fall, but spending on congressional campaigns soars Votes cast and dollars spent on House and Senate elections",multiColumn/imgs/4132.png,"While perceptions of influence are subjective, there’s clearly more money in the U.S. political system now than at any time since the campaign finance reforms of the 1970s, according to a new Pew Research Center data analysis of contributions and spending. That’s the case whether you look at presidential, House or Senate elections.
Last year’s midterm Senate election was the costliest ever – or at least since 1974, when modern disclosure rules kicked in. The 2014 election featured several competitive races, the outcomes of which would determine control of the Senate; Democrats and Republicans fought – and spent – fiercely. According to our analysis of Campaign Finance Institute data, nearly $1.1 billion was spent on 2014’s Senate races by candidates, parties and outside groups, 25% more than in the previous off-year cycle of 2010. The biggest increase was in non-party independent expenditures, which soared from $105.6 million (inflation-adjusted) to $387.3 million.
But despite all that money and attention, voter turnout in last year’s Senate elections didn’t increase; in fact, it was the lowest since 1990. We calculated turnout using estimates of the voting-eligible population (all citizens of voting age, at home and abroad, excepting ineligible felons) made by University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald. Only about 44 million people voted for Senate in 2014, according to tabulations published by the House Clerk’s office – 38% of the voting-eligible population in those states with Senate elections.",https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/12/07/as-more-money-flows-into-campaigns-americans-worry-about-its-influence/,multiColumn/data/4132.txt,line,complex,U.S. Politics & Policy,multiColumn/bboxes/4132.json,multi_col-4132.txt,"Vote totals may rise or fall, but spending on congressional campaigns soars  | Votes cast and dollars spent on House and Senate elections  | Senate  | House  | 140 million votes  | $1.4b  | 140 million votes  | $1.4b  | Expenditures  | (2014 dollars)  | 120  | 1.2  | 120  | 1.2  | Expenditures  | (2014 dollars)  | 100  | 1.0  | 100  | 1.0  | Total votes cast  | 80  | 0.8  | 80  | 0.8  | Total votes cast  | 60  | 06  | -60  | 06  | 40  | 0.4  | 40  | 0.4  | 20  | 0.2  | 20  | 0.2  | '74 .78 '82 '86 '90 '94 '98 '02 '06 '10 '14  | '74 '78 '82 '86 `90 '94 '98 '02 ``66 '10 114  | Note: Turnout in House and Senate elections typically is higher in preside ential-election years than in mid-term elections.  | Turnout in Senate elections also is affected by which states (large, small or mids ized) are electing featuring senators in any particular  | year.

Women under age 50 were nearly three times more likely than men in that same age group to say Smith’s death was the story they followed most closely last week (23% vs. 8%, respectively).
Other top stories of the week included the 2008 presidential campaign and the terrorist bombing in Afghanistan outside a base where Vice President Dick Cheney was staying. The campaign continues to attract more attention than the 2004 presidential contest did in its early stages. The Afghanistan bombing was followed very closely by 19% of the public; 3% said this was the story they followed most closely.

A Pew Research Center report released today looks specifically at the political news habits of Millennials, and how they vary from the two generations before them. Here are five key takeaways from the report:
Millennials rely on Facebook for their news far more than any other source. About six-in-ten online Millennials (61%) report getting political news on Facebook in a given week. Baby Boomers’ political media habits, on the other hand, are strongly rooted in local TV: A majority of them (60%) say they turn there for political news. Millennials’ relatively low reliance on local TV (37% watch political news there in a given week) almost mirrors Baby Boomers’ low reliance on Facebook (39%). Gen Xers bridge the gap, with about equal portions of online adults in this generation getting political news from Facebook (51%) and local TV (46%).",https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/01/political-news-habits-by-generation/,data/757.txt,bar,simple,Journalism & Media,bboxes/757.json,two_col-757.txt,"Millennials and Baby Boomers: A  | Generational Divide in Sources Relied  | on for Political News  | % who got news about politics and government in the  | previous weekfrom...  | Facebook  | 61%  | 60  | Local  | TV  | 39  | 37%  | Millennial  | Baby Boomer  | American Trends Panel (wave 1).

no_data-13108,In Millions of Viewers Late Night,multiColumn/imgs/5500.png,"Bucking a long-range trend of declining viewership, the audience for local TV news grew in all three major time slots in 2013. Viewership climbed 6% in the morning (5 to 7 a.m.) and 3% in the early evening (5 to 7 p.m.) newscasts, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis. The audience barely edged up—by .1%—in the late night slot (11 p.m.), a newscast that had suffered the biggest decreases in recent years.
The good news comes after a difficult 2012 when late night and early evening audiences each dropped by 7% and the morning audience decreased by 5%. Indeed, viewership for all three slots had declined every year from 2008-2012—with the exception of a small uptick in 2011. Pew Research analyzes Nielsen Media Research audience data for all four major sweeps periods — February, May, July and November — and computes national averages for each time slot.
The jump in viewership in the key timeslots was due largely to significant increases in the November sweeps period when morning news was up 12%, early evening grew by 8% and late night increased by 6%. While it is impossible to know whether the 2013 numbers are a harbinger of a new spurt of audience growth, they coincide with a wave of consolidation that has seen bullish media companies—from Gannett to Tribune—buy up large groups of stations.
While the 2013 numbers are encouraging, the overall trend in local television news audience has not been positive. Even including 2013, the morning newscasts—the most consistent viewership performer in local news—has lost 3% of its audience since 2007. The decrease from 2007-2013 in early evening news viewership has been more dramatic—12%. And overall, the late night newscasts have lost about one-sixth of their viewers (17%) in that time period.",https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/28/local-tv-audiences-bounce-back/,multiColumn/data/5500.txt,line,complex,Journalism & Media,multiColumn/bboxes/5500.json,multi_col-5500.txt,"Local News Viewership in Key Time Slots Over Time  | In Millions of Viewers  | 30  | Late Night  | News  | 25  | Early Evening  | News  | 20  | 15  | Morning News  | 10  | 5  | 2007  | 2008  | 2010  | 2011  | 2012  | 2013  | Source: Nielsen Media Research, used under license  | Note: Num bers represent ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC affiliates March 2009 ratings are not  | comparable to the tra ditiona winter sweeps period, February, and therefore 2009 num bers  | are not inc lud ed here.  | PEW RESEARCH CENTER "

In fact, the story evokes a typical response from the public when compared with news interest in past Washington scandals. Amid calls for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales’ resignation, the news media’s coverage of the story outstripped public interest. Most Americans remained focused on the Iraq war and the problems facing returning soldiers.
Overall, 19% of the public paid very close attention to news about the fired U.S. attorneys and 8% said this was the single news story they followed more closely than any other. The news media devoted 16% of its coverage overall to the firings – an eight-fold increase over the week of March 5 – making it the most covered story of the week. Public interest increased as well though at a lower rate. Democrats followed the U.S. attorneys story more closely than Republicans (23% vs. 15%, respectively, followed it very closely).This story did generate more public interest than the recent verdict in the Scooter Libby trial – one of last week’s most covered news stories. Only 13% followed that story very closely.
While the news media focused on how Gonzales and the White House were connected to the U.S. attorney firings, the public remained intensely focused on the Iraq War. Fully 34% said they followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely and 23% listed Iraq as the story they followed most closely last week. Nearly as many (31%) followed news about conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and more general stories about problems with medical care for wounded soldiers returning from Iraq.

In addition to social and political issues, social media also serve as places where conversations about race intersect with a number of issues, including pop culture, sports and everyday personal experiences.
A new Pew Research Center survey finds significant differences in the way black and white adults use social media to share and interact with race-related content1 And a Pew Research Center analysis of tweets reveals that key news events – from Baltimore, to Charleston, South Carolina, to Dallas – often serve as a catalyst for social media conversations about race.
